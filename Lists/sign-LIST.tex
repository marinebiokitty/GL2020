%% This file sets up the Sign and Label datatypes and creates Sign and
%% Label macros.
%%
%% Signs generally represent interesting parts of game area, usually
%% as things posted on walls.  Labels represent other things, often on
%% or inside envelopes, that are part of complex mechanics.
%%
%% The default value for \MYloc will inherit location from the Place
%% or Sign most immediately up the ownership tree.  Override this by
%% setting \MYloc to anything (even blank).
%%
%% Sign is for full-sized signs that would cover most of a large
%% manila envelope; SignMedium is for signs sized to half-sized manila
%% envelopes; SignSmall is for signs sized for small manila envelopes
%% (the same size as item cards).  Label, LabelMedium, and LabelSmall
%% are analagous, but they don't have a \takedownby note at the
%% bottom.  You can always use a sign or label without an envelope or
%% with a differently-sized envelope.  Choose which based on
%% visibility and content.
%%
%% SignTiny is for signs you want to be hard to find; it is small and
%% does not have a \takedownby note.  SignDot is for a very small
%% "dot" which only has a title.
%%
%% SignStrip produces a strip of paper (without a \takedownby note)
%% with labels on the outside that show on both sides if you fold it
%% in half.  These are a convenient alternative to sub-envelopes. They
%% can also be used for "s-packets" taped to walls (see
%% Extras/README-s-packets).
%%
%% LabelCover produces a label similar to the cover to a research
%% notebook.  LabelPage, likewise, produces a page.
%%
%% EOG is for full-sized end-of-game signs.

Proximity with the portal for even a few moments leaves you with a sense of divinity. Could this be a portal to the Realm of the Gods? How was it created? The Gods themselves severed the connection between the Divine Realm and the mortal plane in time immemorial.

If it really is a portal to the Realm of the Gods, you could theoretically go talk to the patron deities! And who knows what else you might find? But navigating the Divine Realm is likely to be a challenge. It is possible that you will accomplish nothing but wandering lost in the mist for a while.

\textbf{You may pass through this portal to enter the Divine Realm. You may only stay for a maximum of 30 minutes, else you will become a denizen of the Divine Realm and be unable to return to the Mortal Realm.} You cannot be kept in the Divine Realm past this timer against your will. If you are knocked out or restrained, simply return to the Mortal Realm when your 30 timer is up. If you were knocked out, you remain knocked out, just on the Mortal side of the Portal. If you were restrained, you are now free since the person previously restraining you is presumably still in the Divine Realm. \textbf{You must remain on the Mortal Plane for at least 20 minutes before returning to the Divine Realm.}

To enter the Divine Realm, turn your badge to the ``Not Here’’ side, and use the ``out of game symbol’’ (hand on head or equivalent). Relocate to the ``\sMagicPortalTwo{}’’ sign in the Divine Realm.

The ``\iScythe{}’’ was the culprit’s weapon. It is one of the only ways to attack an Avatar and have a chance of success, and it is for exactly this reason that it is kept deep in the Library, where it is supposed to be protected.

It follows therefore that whoever killed the Ebb avatar must have had access to the library in the past few months. Which obligates the direct culprit to be a teacher or a student, although an Advisor could have been involved in orchestrating the matter.

The Goddesses must leave it up to you to determine who had the motivation. If you can find the culprit, you can bring them to justice. It won’t bring the avatar back on its own; in fact you could resurrect the Avatar without doing this, but who’s to say they won’t just try again if they are not found and stopped? And the Wave Rider guiding tenet of balance demands the culprit pay an equivalent price to the pain, suffering, and death that they caused.}

And so they went to the other gods, and through persuasion and logic, trickery, bribery, and unexpected kindnesses, convinced the entire pantheon that they were correct. And so the Deities brought their power together and created \pEarth{}. Upon it they placed the single continent by the same name. This single land mass represents the cooperation of all the Gods, and the wonders that they could create when united.} 

\emph{When the primary work was done, a council was called among all the gods to determine who would create the race of beings most like the Deities themselves. The vote was unanimous, and perhaps not unexpected. Those who had originally brought the idea should create its crowning glory. And so \cFarmGod{}, \cTechGod{}, and the twin \cEbb{\God}es \cEbb{} and \cFlow{} set about creating humanity, each in their own way. The four Deities pooled their power together for a gift to humanity — the gift of Magic. This gift would help them weather the Magical Storms that ravaged \pEarth{} every three years. And so upon \pEarth{} there walk 3 peoples, and their Patron Deities rule the Pantheon.}

\emph{In the beginning, all of the Deities were equal in the nothingness. A Deity whose name is now lost to time conceived of something new: a world — tangible and real, to be created by the Deities as a distraction from the endless existence. This Deity had a power none of the others had — the ability to make something out of nothing. The other Deities were quick to embrace this new idea, so much so that they began fighting over who would oversee the creation and control the new world. Conflicts became more and more violent. Factions formed, the strongest of which was the four Deities who would eventually become the Patron Gods. In an act that would reverberate through the rest of time, the Patron Gods struck a mortal wound upon the Deity who had originally conceived the idea of a world. With their dying breath, this Deity begged the other Gods to set aside their quarrels and be content in each other.} 

\emph{Never before had the Pantheon needed to face the loss of one of their number. Each Deity processed the loss in their own way. \cFarmGod{} spiraled into depression. \cTechGod{} succumbed to anger. The Twin Goddesses \cEbb{} and \cFlow{} turned to denial. As a whole, the Pantheon heeded the dying words of the Deity who had so inspired them, and for a time, there was peace. They all worked together to create the world now known as Cengea out of the corpse of the Deity who had conceived it, as a way to honor their memory.}

\emph{But the fragile peace was not to last. When the question arose of peopling the world with sentient beings, bitter arguments broke out. Each Deity wanted to create humanity in their own image. Arguments soon turned to violence once more; so intense was the struggle that the very land buckled, creating the mountain range known as the Bones of the World. In the end, the Patron Gods were triumphant once more, but they had learned their lesson regarding murder. Instead, they imprisoned the other Deities in the formless void that still existed outside of creation, the Underworld, placing the gates deep within a floating island that none could reach. Thus imprisoned, the Deities who would come to be known as the Minor Gods had their power vastly curtailed.}

\emph{The Patron Gods then set about the work of creating humanity, each Deity fashioning one of the nations in their own image. When their work was complete, the very first rule they established was a ban on murder, hoping to pass down to their creations the painful lesson they had learned. Humanity flourished under the watchful eyes of the Patron Gods, for a time. But over the years, the rage and anguish of the Minor Gods at being imprisoned festered and grew behind the Gates of the Underworld, involuntarily manifesting as a devastating Storm. When at last the gates could contain the Storm no longer, it burst outward in all directions, ravaging the entire continent — a process which would repeat every three years.}

In time, humans discovered the floating island, and that their magical rituals were strongest near the Ley Line Nexus. They developed a ritual that could be performed there to guide the Storm and limit the extent of the devastation, and built a school to raise up young mages powerful enough to perform the ritual.

Around the edges of the space, you will find \textbf{5 receptacles} (envelopes with signs listing colors on them.) The pieces of construction paper currently in this envelope will need to be moved, one by one, to the receptacle that matches its colors (e.g. red pieces of paper goes in the ``red'' receptacle).

In order to begin the task, someone must take the envelope full of pieces of construction paper up to the balcony above the lounge, and scatter all of the paper pieces from there. They will end up all over the first floor area of the lounge. Any pieces of paper that land on the second floor balcony should be dropped over the edge until they end up on the first floor somewhere. The person who did this may then come down and join in the task of organizing all of the pieces of paper.

There are constraints on how this must be done:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Only 1 piece of paper may be picked up from the ground at a time. Once one piece of paper is picked up from the floor by someone, it must be placed in its receptacle envelope before another one can be picked up.
	\item Pieces of paper may only be handed from one character to another. Paper may not be tossed at any time or placed in any intermediate carrying containers. This means forming passing chains.
	\item Once you have touched a piece of paper that has been picked up from the floor, you may not change your spatial positioning (e.g. cannot walk to a new position) until it has been deposited into its receptacle. This includes touching through cloth (aka wearing gloves does not avoid this part of the mechanic.) This means that you may need more than just a few people to complete this mechanic if papers are scattered far away from their target receptacles.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If a piece of paper gets dropped accidentally, you can go retrieve it, just come back to the place you were.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Once pieces of paper reach their target receptacle, they cannot be removed. In other words, this task cannot be undone once it is complete.

Everyone else must risk harm during the storm surge. (see the ``\gStormSurgeInside{}'' greensheets posted in each game space for more information.)

\textbf{To repair the bunkers:}\\
The bunkers consist of a \textbf{physical layer} and a \textbf{magical layer}. Progress either part of the repairs will increase the number of people the bunker can protect.

In the attached envelope you will find 1 Greensheet for each part that needs to be repaired. There are \textbf{3 copies} of each of these greensheets. One copy of these greensheets must stay with this sign. You may borrow the other two copies, but they should always be returned here. You should also feel free to take a picture for reference, or ask the GMs to print you a copy if none are available to borrow. 

\emph{(OOC: Greensheets are OOC information, but these are public sheets that anyone may look at. The sheets may not be stolen, hidden, or destroyed however. This is a kludge for game balance.)}
