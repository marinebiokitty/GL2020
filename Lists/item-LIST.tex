%% This file creates the Item, ItemPacket, ItemFold, ItemEnvelope, and

%% Item macros are for normal item cards.
\DECLARESUBTYPE{Item}{TransElement}
\PRESETS{Item}{
  \FD\MYtext	{} %% longer text of item

%% \unstash
%% \bulky{<number>}

%% \prop inside an Item macro labels the card as a prop.  \unstash
%% labels the card as unstashable.  \bulky{n} labels the card as
%% n-hands bulky.  \contain{n} labels the card with n-hands capacity.

%% They are a subtype of Item.

%% ItemFold macros are for items represented by just a folded packet.

%% left blank, since they have no actual item card.
\DECLARESUBTYPE{ItemFold}{ItemPacket}
\PRESETS{ItemFold}{

%% ItemEnvelope macros are for items represented by just an envelope.

%% left blank, since they have no actual item card.
\DECLARESUBTYPE{ItemEnvelope}{ItemPacket}
\PRESETS{ItemEnvelope}{
  \s\MYmark{}

%% ItemLabel macros are for small labels that would get used on
%% physreps, e.g. gun labels.  The ``mark'' is left blank, since
%% it isn't used for these.
