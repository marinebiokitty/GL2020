\textsl{Your grandparents, your father, and I are doing fine. Work at the bank is steady, and pays the bills. We even took your grandparents to the theater last week. It was quite lovely, although we all miss you, as we always do, when you’re away at work.}

\textsl{I know it’s dangerous to put this in a letter, but I just had to thank you again for saving all of our lives. If you hadn’t done what you did, surely we would all be dead instead of that pirate. It is times like this that I wonder if \cTechGod{} could really be so cruel, or if this is somehow the church’s doing, twisting the true words of the Deities to suit their own purposes. But no, the church doesn’t have the ability to invoke amnesia like this. Does it?}

\textsl{I really wish you hadn’t chosen to go back to the \pSchool{}. Surely your risk of being discovered is much greater than if you’d sent a sudden resignation letter. I must trust that your father advised you well, however, that this really is your best chance of piecing your life back together.}
