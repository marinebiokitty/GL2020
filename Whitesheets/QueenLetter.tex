\emph{[This letter bears the Queenâ€™s \textbf{personal} seal, marking it as completely legitimate. It is noteworthy that \cQueen{\full} used her personal seal, rather than the seal of the royal family, but it never-the-less carries equal legitimacy and authority. There is no known magic or mundane means to create a fake that stands up to any scrutiny.]}
