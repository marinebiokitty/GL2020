The clerics of \cFarmGod{} hold the magical music of healing tight in their grasp. So tightly that it is out of reach for far too many of the \pFarmers{}. You don’t care if it’s blasphemous, you have plans to create a device that will perpetually hold that magic, so anyone can access it, any time they need it.

\textbf{To create your magic music box:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Discuss music theory for \textbf{5 min} with someone who is \textbf{not} a cleric. You may shorten the time to only 2 minutes if you speak with \cMusic{\full} since this is \cMusic{\their} area of expertise.
  \item Discuss the healing power of music for 5 min with a cleric. You may shorten the time to only 2 minutes if you speak with \cDisney{\full} or \cHedonist{\full} but the trade off is that they may become suspicious of you.
  \item Build a prototype music box in the Maker’s space.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the following items:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item 1 ``\iMagitechParts{}'' (probably best sourced from the black market)
      \item 1 ``\iWoodenBlock{}'' (there’s got to be one around here somewhere)
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Spend 5 minutes roleplaying building your prototype. You may shorten the time to only 2 minutes if \cChupAvenger{\full}, \cBunker{\full} or \cTechStar{\full} helps you.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Retrieve your ``\iProtypeMusicBox{}'' from sign D.
  \item Watch someone perform healing magic while you hold the prototype box. You \textbf{must} explain to them (before they start) that you are trying to learn how to duplicate what they are doing by watching them with this item.
  \item Retrieve the ``\iMagicMusicBox{}'' item from inside the ``\iProtypeMusicBox{}’’ envelope. Discard the ``\iProtypeMusicBox{}'' item to the nearest stock.
  \item Find a way to get the ``\iMagicMusicBox{}'' \textbf{imbued with magic.} This is some technomagic that will allow your music box to retain its magical effect forever. Someone from the \pTech{} surely knows how to do this. If they refuse, the Black Market can probably help with this too.
  \item Anyone can now cast basic healing magic as long as they are in possession of this music box. There is an ability inside the ``\iMagicMusicBox{}’’ item that can be freely read that explains how.
\end{enumerate}

See if you can get the \cHeir{\formal} family heir (\cHeir{\full}) to agree to have the family mass produce these so that you can get them into the hands of as many people as possible!
