\name{\gAssassinateWarlord{}}

The following mechanic describes how to create a fast acting poison and use it to assassinate \cLoud{\full}, leader of the \pShip{} warmongers plaguing your shores. \cEvil{\full} and \cDiplomat{\full} are conspiring on this. If you wish to use the poison for another purpose, contact a GM.

To make the poison, you will need the following material components:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item 1 ``\iSlowActingPoison{}''
  \item A vial of blood from the Warlord’s child, \cWarlordDaughter{\full}. You start game with an ``\iGlassVial{}''. The item card has more information on how to draw blood.
\end{enumerate}

The above Curse can be obtained from trained Cursemakers, hailing from the \pFarm{}, such as \cPrince{\full} and \cCurse{\full}. Be cautious who you ask and how, though, as asking for a ``\iSlowActingPoison{}'' could easily raise suspicions. Watch your timing as well, as these curses can take a while to prepare, even once they have been commissioned.

Once you have the three components, you can combine them to make Fast Acting Poison using the following ritual:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The ritual must be performed in a place which has known violence and/or death, such as the Graveyard, the Combat Circle in the Training Ground, the Student Lounge where the students perished six years ago, or a location which has experienced violence during game.
  \item The ritual requires two participants. One participant holds the Curse, the other holds the vial of blood.
  \item The participants lock eyes and circle each other, chanting nine times in unison, “Pour forth our malice into this vessel.”
  \item Discard the two item cards of the components to the nearest stock. If the ritual gets interrupted, the items are not destroyed, but you must start over.
  \item After completing the ritual, retrieve the ``\iFastActingPoison{}'' item from ``\sSignP{}'' in GM headquarters.
\end{enumerate}

The next step is to send the poison in a letter to one of your \pShip{} agents; you can do this through the normal letter writing mechanic (the letters home ability does not normally allow you to send items; this mechanic overrides that). This step must be accomplished by \textbf{Saturday night}, as your agent needs time to get into position. 

Lastly, you must get \cLoud{} to go to the Goddesses’ Lighthouse, a particular island in 1st Fleet territory, where your assassin will lie in wait. In order to accomplish this, you must get either \cWarlordDaughter{} or two out of the four L’eau Advisors (\cChupLeader{\full}; \cJuniorStatesman{\full}; \cBunker{\full}; and \cEbbPriest{\full}) to send a letter to the Warlord asking them to go there. You cannot do this step until at least the morning after you have sent the poison to your agent; otherwise, the timing will not work and the attempt will fail. 

If you complete the above steps within the aforementioned timeline, the assassination is expected to succeed.
