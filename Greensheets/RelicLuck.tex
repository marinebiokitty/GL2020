You may use this relic to improve your luck temporarily.

\textbf{Number of Uses: U; Relic must be attuned somewhere.}

To use this relic to auto succeed on a mechanic that uses a randomization mechanic that was previously failed:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The \iHorseshoe{} MUST be attuned to someplace in order to use this ability.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Check the item-envelope to see if there is a piece of paper inside it (do not read the paper; do not even pull it out of the envelope if you can avoid it).
    \item If there is \textbf{no} paper, this ability \textbf{cannot} be used until the Relic is re-attuned to someplace.
    \item Using this ability successfully will cause the Relic to become de-attuned.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item You may declare a success on an otherwise failed mechanic that required rolling a D20. You do NOT need to expend the use of this effect until after you see the outcome!
  \item After resolving the mechanic, the horseshoe becomes deattuned. Open the item-envelope for the ``\iHorseshoe{},'' take out the piece of paper inside without reading it, and discard it to the nearest stock or give it to the nearest GM.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{DO NOT} read what the piece of paper said.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

To use this relic to improve your ability to resist attacks:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The \iHorseshoe{} MUST be attuned to someplace in order to use this ability.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Check the item-envelope to see if there is a piece of paper inside it (do not read the paper; do not even pull it out of the envelope if you can avoid it).
    \item If there is \textbf{no} paper, this ability \textbf{cannot} be used until the Relic is re-attuned to someplace.
    \item Using this ability successfully will cause the Relic to become de-attuned.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item You may treat your CR as 100 for the purposes of resisting one attack.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The relic does not have any effect on your CR for attacking; only for defending.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item After resolving the attack, the horseshoe becomes deattuned. Open the item-envelope for the ``\iHorseshoe{},'' take out the piece of paper inside without reading it, and discard it to the nearest stock or give it to the nearest GM.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{DO NOT} read what the piece of paper said.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
