A good reference doc/guide for things we can anticipate players might want, and notes to remind us of stuff.

{\large ITEM NUMBERS}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item ARE 4 digits long!
	\item Notes to/from \cChupInventor{} start with item number ``21\ldots ''
	\item Only 1 item: the \iFolderOfNotes{} from \cBunker{} that \cDisney{} has start with ``31\ldots ’’
	\item Technology that can be imbued by the FPF Clerics must start with ``45\ldots ''
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \iMagicMusicBox{}
		\item \iVidCom{}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item The sea serpent baby starts with ``51…’’
	\item The most commonly needed things:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \iRitualCandle{}
		\item \iGlassVial{}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Other items have completely random/arbitrary numbers starting with ``9\ldots ’’
\end{enumerate}

{\large Pregame stuff:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Make sure everyone gets a D20.
	\item Check with \cPrincipal{\MYplayer} for whatever the Principal's badge of office is.
	\item Give each of the \pGoaties{} a green pin, or check that they have their own 4 leaf clover symbol. \cChupAvenger{\MYplayer} should be reminded that once game starts \cChupAvenger{\they} must display the symbol openly.
	\item Record what each cursemakers choose as their maker’s mark.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Fill in other marks for the curses \cHedonist{\MYplayer} has.
		\item Get \cPrince{\MYplayer} to put the mark on \cInitiate{\MYplayer}’s bad luck curse.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

{\large In Game stuff:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Curses - GM will drop in the appropriate folder in GM HQ for the cursemaker to pick up after 1 hour.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Cursemakers will let you know when they start brewing something
		\item GMs will have 1 hour to get a copy of the curse/cure into their little envelope attached to ``\sCurses{}'' sign in GM HQ. We will have a few printed out initially, but if you notice demand is heavy for one in particular, make sure we print /assemble more before we are completely out.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Inventions - GM must approve.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The technology must already exist; only minor modifications are allowed. The scitzotech of the world makes this hard, but in general:
		\item \textbf{NO:} batteries, engines, weapons, flight, memory restoration, anything that duplicates magic that is exclusive to a subset of characters (no making a machine to heal, or a cursmaking machine), anything as powerful or more powerful than the relics, or anything that negates the big public plots (e.g.: building new bunkers from scratch).
		\item \textbf{MAYBE:} Can only make \iVidCom{} if you have the \iVCDBlueprint{} in hand. If it is going to short circuit a plot. If it has the same functionality as an existing curse (cures are probably a no).
			\item Black market can provide ``\iMagitechParts{}'' item (chup inventor has a mechanic for regulating risk).
		\item 1 \iMagitechParts{} parts for up to 2 hands bulky. 3 or 4 hands would require consuming 2 \iMagitechParts{} parts. Anything that would reasonably be bigger than 4-hands bulky is almost certainly out of the scope of game to build.
		\item Once you okay an invention, go straight to GM HQ and prepare the item card for the inventor, as it only takes them 10 minutes, and we can't have these prepared ahead of time.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Advisors have the ability to send letters home. Will need to respond. Use prepared wax seals.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Letters sent after 11 am on Sun can be ignored unless a GM has time to kill somehow.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item \cWarlordDaughter{}’s RN has them write a letter to \cQuiet{} asking if anything suspicious happened in the weeks leading up to \cLoud{}'s sudden personality change.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item GMs should write a response that acknowledges the specific message the player wrote while also revealing that: \cLoud{} and \cQuiet{} blamed the Council of Stormwatchers for being too soft as the crux of the problem/ultimate reason for the betrayal. They contracted \cCurse{\full} to create a curse that would empower one of them to rise in national politics and be the backbone they thought the country needed. But the curse was way more potent than they had bargained for. They never wanted \textbf{this}, but they don’t know how to stop it.
		\item At the meal AFTER we receive a \iPanacea{} from \cWarlordDaughter{}, send the WR advisors the official resignation letter: \cChupLeader{}, \cJuniorStatesman{}, \cBunker{}, and \cEbbPriest{}. Send \cWarlordDaughter{} the personal resignation letter. Both are stored in GM HQ.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Avatars - GMs generally need to play Avatars and the Deities.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Resurrecting the Ebb Avatar requires a GM. You must consult the current list of FoG members to see whether the ritual feels weird. If any FoG members participate, tell the ritual leader something felt weird.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item At the end of the ritual, switch out the \iBabySeaSerpent{} item card for the \iAvatarSeaSerpent{} Item card. Add +3 to the CR of the baby sea serpent to set the CR of Ebb’s new avatar.
		\end{enumerate}
		\item Summoning the Avatar of Genesis requires a GM in case they want to talk to it. Swap out the \iRabbitStatue{} card for the \iAvatarRabbit{} card.
		\item Talking to the \iAvatarBeetle{} requires a GM, as does the WR cleric special ability.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Inducting someone into the FoG requires a GM: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{FoG headcount - need to keep a list of who has been inducted, and when.}
		\item Add the new person’s name to the GM list of FoG members.
		\item Have the person set their \textbf{V-Score = 1}
		\item If a \textbf{student}, and it is before 9pm on Saturday give them the \textbf{new morality sheet} and have them set their \textbf{morality score = 0}. 4 Extra \pGoaties{} morality sheets have already been printed; others will need to be printed on demand.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Promoting a Cleric or Consecrating an Avenger requires a GM:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item GM plays the avatar; accept the person, do a formal ``swearing in’’ (make it up!)
		\item For Consecrating an Avenger, make sure they change their \textbf{V-score=2}.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Many of the Preparations for the Storm need to be checked by a GM or have a GM be told the thing.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item We have a copy of the preparations in GM HQ. Check things off and make any notes about incomplete/poorly completed tasks. This is important for the secret other way the school can become a storm target. See the ``\gTallyingVotes{}'' greensheet.
		\item Ritual leaders for the ritual to control the storm must submit their plan by Noon on Sunday so GMs can prepare over lunch.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Voting Mechanics
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 9pm on Saturday is the cut off. Scores and rankings not submitted by then are probably forfeit, depending if we feel generous.
		\item Use the Voting Authority greensheet to figure out how many stones each person gets.
		\item Give stones and the tally greensheet (stapled to hide the middle) to \cPrincipal{} Sunday Morning
		\item There is a separate Voting tally greensheet for actually counting up the votes and figuring out where the storm is going to be sent.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Repairing the bunkers:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item GMs must approve the lego designs based on the GS constraints and the 3 designs not looking too similar to each other.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item The Library: Most of the Library choose-your-own-adventure does not require a GM, but there are a few parts that do:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Characters can conduct research at the hubs of each of the first 3 tiers of the Library and at the Heart of the Library in tier 4, which, if successful, lets them ask the GMs a question. Tier 1 answers are only \textbf{common knowledge} (e.g. what’s in the bluesheets other than the FoG bluesheet). Tiers 2, 3, and 4 answers should be progressively more esoteric/secret, \textbf{as long as they don’t short-circuit an existing plot} (i.e. information that is gated by a research notebook or greensheet). In such cases you are free to give hints or suggest where to look in game to find more information, though.
		\item If people want to do something in the Library that is not among the listed options, they can ask a GM. Feel free to tell them they can’t if it doesn’t seem reasonable or would break things. Otherwise, you are free to make up the results.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
