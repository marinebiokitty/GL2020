\name{\gCursemakingAdvanced{}}

\textbf{This greensheet builds directly on the ``\gCursemakingBasic{}'' greensheet that you should also have.}

You have learned the secret of enhancing curses, allowing you to create more complex spells. Beyond the basic curse preparation, you now know how to create more advanced and dangerous curses. You may create curses with \textbf{ $>$2 ingredients}.

Unlike a less experienced Cursemaker, you are able to read the maker’s marks on curses, and thus know who made the curse if you are already familiar with their handiwork.

\textbf{Crafting Curses:}
The method for crafting curses with the Advanced skill is the same as with the Basic skill, except that the \textbf{default} charging/brewing time for an advanced curse (requiring $>$2 ingredients) is \textbf{30 minutes, unless another mechanic says otherwise} (e.g. certain special curses will take longer).

\textbf{Recipes:}
Below is a list of recipes you know. Other recipes may exist. If someone brings you a recipe that requires 4 or fewer ingredients, you can make it. Feel free to write the recipe down on this sheet for future reference.

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{| >{\centering\arraybackslash} m{2.5cm} | >{\centering\arraybackslash} m{5.5cm} | X |}
\hline
	\textbf{Curse Name (item number)} & \textbf{Ingredients (item number)}  & \textbf{Effect} \\
\hline
\hline
	\iSlowActingPoison{}	&	\iWeakness{}, \iRestraint{}, \iFish{} & The target will die in several days \emph{(OOC this will kill the character post-game. Whoever activates the curse on the target will lose their memories at that time.)}\\
\hline	
	\iSlowActingPoisonCure{}	&	\iCourage{}, \iLily{}, \iStoneFlower{} & Cures the effects of the \iSlowActingPoison{} before any harm is done. \\
\hline	
	\iHonesty{}	&	\iInsight{}, \iHollyhock{}, Blood from the target & Target must answer the next 1 question truthfully. \textbf{Additional Instructions: } You must write the name of the person who's blood was used on the curse once you receive it. It will not work on anybody else.\\
\hline	
	\iSight{}	&	\iFlameOrchid{}, \iEagleFeather{}, \iHollyhock{} & Immediately cancels the effects of \iBlindness{}, \iRestraint{}, \iBabble{}, \textbf{or} \iWeakness{}; this Cure has \textbf{no effect} on any other type of Curse.\\
\hline	
	\iSkill{}	&	\iStrength{}, \iBlackCrocus{}, \iLimestone{} & Through cleverness and strength the target is able to eliminate the time required for any \textbf{one} mechanic (\textbf{except} Library research), resolving the mechanic instantly . E.g. If something requires meditating for 5 minutes, they may accomplish that thing immediately. This includes the charging time for curses.\\
\hline	
	\iBadLuckCurse{}	&	\iWeakness{}, \iBabble{}, \iCharcoal{} & The target is \textbf{permanently} cursed with terrible luck, affecting every aspect of their life. \textbf{Additional Instructions:} You must have a GM approve a specific ``release'' location or action. (You may pick any location that is reasonable to expect someone could reach in epilogue. Likewise, you may pick a task that could be completed in epilogue; however, you may not specify a task which is forbidden by the target’s Patron Deity.) \\
