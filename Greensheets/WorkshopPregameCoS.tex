\section*{(50-60 min)}

Hello and welcome. Once again my name is X and my pronouns are Y. If you are here, it is because your character is from the \pFarm{}. If you are not from this nation, you're in the wrong place!

Over the next hour we are going to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Introduce ourselves and our characters.
	\item Create some social and cultural norms for the \pFarm{}, which can help us feel like a more coherent group.
	\item Reflect on the social inequalities present in our society and where we fall within them.
	\item Reflect on the impact the war has had on the nation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Player / Character Introductions (5 min)}
We’re going to go around the circle and introduce \textbf{players}. Please share your name, pronouns, and what state you live in normally. Use the 1st person for this. $<$GM models$>$

We’re going to go around again, this time introducing your \textbf{character}. Please share your character’s name, pronouns, what nation they are from, and whether they are a student, teacher or an advisor. Use the 1st person for this too. $<$GM models$>$

\subsection*{Social and Cultural norms (20 min)}
Split yourselves up into 3 groups of 4-5. I’m going to give each group a different Q. You’ll decide the answer in your group, then we’ll come back together and share it with the rest of the group. The answer can be words, or actions, but shouldn't take more than 1 sentence to explain. We’ll split off again with a second and then third question. If we have time, we’ll practice with these norms.

Round 1:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item How do we say hello / goodbye?
	\item How do we express approval and disapproval?
	\item How do we swear?
\end{enumerate}

Round 2:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is a sign of moderate wealth? What about great wealth?
	\item What symbolic object is present in almost every home (or on every ship)?
	\item What is one thing we judge people negatively for doing?
\end{enumerate}

Round 3:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What action or activity do most of us do regularly that is steeped in tradition?
	\item What holiday is the biggest celebration for us? When is it?
	\item How often are group religious services held? Do lay people have roles in these services, or just clerics and initiates?
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{If time allows:} Practice these.

\subsection*{Social Inequalities (15 min)}
Let’s all come back together. We are going to reflect on the social structure of our nation, where the characters fall within it, and what changes might or might not be possible for us to enact.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Where does your character fall in the social hierarchy? Pay attention to this; as it will likely influence how you treat each other. \textbf{Have players group themselves by what they think is generally known about their character:}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item born noble vs commoner.
		\item raised noble vs commoner.
		\item Successful at court (e.g.: v powerful, has the queen’s favor) vs. unsuccessful vs unproven.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Does your character approve of the current Ruler (Queen Ameline) and the way she runs her court? \textbf{Arrange Y/N scale.}
	\item Is your character looking forward to the day the Queen’s oldest child takes over? They are very different from their mother, and most people expect them to have a softer touch and be more amenable to social reforms. \textbf{Arrange Y/N scale.}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Discussion Questions:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item How does the nobility do a \textbf{good} job of embodying the idea that with great power comes great responsibility?
	\item Where do they fall short?
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Impact of The War (10 min)}
Now we are going to reflect on the impact of the war. Let’s make one big circle. I’m going to ask a couple of questions, for personal reflection. We wont discuss these now, but you may want to talk about them in character later:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Where in the country does your character live when not at the College? How close is your home to the fighting? Has your home been damaged or destroyed by the war?
	\item How many people did you know personally who have been hurt or killed?
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Discussion Question:} How has the demand for curses to support the war effort disrupted the normal social order?


Alright, last up is a workshop by Cohort. Check your manila envelope for which GM you are going to be with next.
