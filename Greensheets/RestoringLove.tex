\name{\gRestoringLove{}}

Losing your romantic relationship with \cHeadScientist{\full} was the last straw. No matter how much you believe in the \pGoaties{}’ mission, you just can’t be part of it any more. But just leaving the \pGoaties{} will not restore \cHeadScientist{}’s memories of your time together. You aren’t sure it’s possible to do that. But you’ve got to try. The relationship the two of you had meant so much to both of you.

Your best guess right now is to try to recreate touchstones of your relationship with \cHeadScientist{}; hopefully without weirding \cHeadScientist{\them} out so much that they won’t talk to you (starting with claiming a forgotten relationship and confessing to being part of a secret, blasphemous cult is a great way to weird them out so they won’t talk to you). You hope that the touchstones will spark individual memories to return. And you don’t necessarily have to do this alone. \cInitiate{\full} has already volunteered \cInitiate{\themself} to help. And of course, there is \cChupInventor{\full}, whom you know as one of the \pGoaties{} (although they have also forgotten you). \cChupInventor{} is \cHeadScientist{}’s best friend. If you can figure out how to convince \cChupInventor{\them}, surely \cChupInventor{\they} would help you too.

To restore \cHeadScientist{}’s memories of you, complete the following tasks. Please try to complete the tasks in order, but if you stall out on one for too long, you may skip over it. Once you complete \textbf{task 6} however, you may not go back and complete others for the purposes of this mechanic. After each task, wait approximately 5 minutes, then ask a nearby player or GM to tell \cHeadScienist{} to open the relevant page in \cHeadScientist{\their} mem-book entitled ``\mIdleThoughts{}.’’

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Talk to \cLibrarian{\full} about memory loss, to see if they know anything, or can point you toward any resources. If you can’t find \cLibrarian{}, you can talk to \cLibAssist{\full}, the library assistant, or or \cPresident{\full}, who spends a lot of time there, but you have to get them to promise to tell \cLibrarian{} as soon as possible.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Have \cHeadScientist{} open Page 1 of their mem-book. 
  \end{itemize}
  \item Talk to \cHeadScientist{} 1:1 for at least 3 minutes; engage in pleasantries as if to get to know each other. \cHeadScientist{} doesn’t remember you *at all* and it’s important you ease into this and don’t scare them off.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Have \cHeadScientist{} open \textbf{Page 2} of their mem-book.
  \end{itemize}
  \item The two of you used to help each other out all the time. Get a genuine “thank you” from helping \cHeadScientist{} somehow.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Have \cHeadScientist{} open \textbf{Page 3} of their mem-book.
  \end{itemize}
  \item You used to send \cHeadScientist{} flowers whenever you couldn’t be together. Maybe a bouquet including a \iBlackCrocus{} will spark a memory? \iBlackCrocus{\MYname}es are \cHeadScientist{}’s secret favorite flower. When \cHeadScientist{\they} told you this, \cHeadScientist{\they} explained that it was a secret \cHeadScientist{\they} were sharing with you because \cHeadScientist{} believed you to be \cHeadScientist{\their} true love. Present \cHeadScientist{} with a bouquet of flowers (collect 3 or more item-cards of flowers, at least one of which must be a ``\iBlackCrocus{};'' see a GM for a phys rep.)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Have \cHeadScientist{} open \textbf{Page 4} of their mem-book.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Consensually hold hands with \cHeadScientist{} (default is to mime this; ask before actually physically touching another player.)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Have \cHeadScientist{} open \textbf{Page 5} of their mem-book.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Complete your escape from the FoG (see the greensheet)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Have \cHeadScientist{} open \textbf{Page 6} of their mem-book.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
