\emph{\cCurse{} starts with the ``\iBeansNB{},'' having been working on them at home before arriving.} \cFlowPriest{\full} and \cCurse{\full} have been collaborating on this project for several years now, mailing the work in progress back and forth. Now that you are both here in the same place, at a time of such intense magical energy, you hope to finish the ``\iBeansNB{}’’ and open a portal to the Realm of the Gods.

The gateway grown will be a permanent fixture, so wherever you plant the beans is it. There will be no way to move the portal after the fact. If you would prefer to forego the chance to reach the Divine Realms this weekend, and take the beans home (or send them with someone) to plant somewhere else, you should \textbf{not} plant them (step 8). But are you really going to delay such an amazing accomplishment? No mortal has traveled the Divine Plane since the Deities themselves severed the connection, not long after \pEarth{} was created, and humans set to walk upon it. And the longer you wait, the greater the chance that \textbf{politicians} get involved. The beans could be taken away from you entirely after all of your hard work to do something thought impossible! 

To finish the enchantment on the Beans, complete the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Since the Deities severed the connection to the Realm of the Gods, you’ll need a little of their power to restore it. Get \textbf{4 clerics or initiates} to bless the beans. 
  \item Prepare a Cure of \cCurse{}’s own design. \cCurse{} can either brew it \cCurse{\them}self, or convince another curse maker with advanced skill to do it. This is a modification of a traditional Cure made to try to cleanse seed stock of fungus when there is no fertility magic (aka noble magic) available to do it.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Ingredients: 1 ``\iHollyhock{}'', 1 ``\iFish{}'', 1 ``\iClay{}.
    \item Brew it just like a normal curse/cure. Ask the GMs for an ``\iEyeOfVulture{}.’’ 
    \item While one could theoretically brew multiple of these, using it on these beans is the only mechanic in game that would benefit from it.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Expend the curse on the \iBeansNB{}.
  \item Bring the \iBeansNB{} to ``\sPFlameOne{}'' in the Old Wing of the \pSc{}. Heat the beans over the flame for at least 30 seconds.
  \item Wait 4 hours for the beans to mature. \textbf{OR} if you are in a hurry, you can choose to stay outside of the bunkers during one of the storm surges, the beans will mature much faster with exposure to a storm surge, and will be ready as soon as the surge is over. You may not leave the beans somewhere unattended for this effect.
  \item Open the \iBeansNB{} item envelope. Retrieve the \iBeansMB{} item card from inside, and discard \iBeansNB{} to the nearest stock.
  \item Plant the beans in the Garden (Discard \iBeansMB{} to the nearest stock and \textbf{tell a GM ASAP!}). They will grow into a gateway that will allow passage into the Realm of the Gods. You aren’t entirely sure how long it will take, but you anticipate no more than a few hours (this is a kludge so the GMs can prepare). When the GMs are ready, they will remove ``\sSignB{},’’ Revealing the ``\sMagicPortal{}’’ sign underneath for all to see and interact with.
\end{enumerate}
