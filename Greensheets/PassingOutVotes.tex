The Time of Deciding has arrived, and so the solemn duty of distributing the ``\iVotingStones{}'' to the students falls to you, the Principal and their potential successors: \cPrincipal{\full}, \cMusic{\full}, and \cBeetle{\full}.

The GMs will provide you with the Stones and a list of how many go to each student on Sunday Morning. 

Before distributing the Stones, you must recruit one cleric from each nation to examine them and spend at least two minutes in prayer and meditation with the stones. This is a new process instated after the tragedy 6 years ago. It  is intended to ensure the authenticity of the Stones and the blessings of the Gods over the vote. 

Once the clerics are finished, the three of you must distribute the stones to the students promptly and accurately, as befits the dignity and importance of the occasion. \emph{(OOC Note: Feel free to make up as much pomp and ceremony as you like around this.)}
