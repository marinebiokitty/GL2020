\section*{(40 min)}

Hello and welcome. Once again my name is X and my pronouns are Y. If you are here, it is because your character is an advisor. If you are not an advisor, you're in the wrong place!

Over the next hour we are going to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Introduce ourselves and our characters.
	\item Create some social and cultural norms for our cohort, which can help us feel like a more coherent group.
	\item Reflect on the role of this cohort in the Time of Deciding, and the consequences of the decision before us.
	\item And Reflect on how magic influences these character’s lives.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Character Introductions (5 min)}
We’re going to go around the circle and introduce \textbf{players}. Please share your name, pronouns, and what state you live in normally. Use the 1st person for this. $<$GM models$>$

We’re going to go around the circle and introduce our \textbf{character}. Please share your character’s name, pronouns, and what nation they are from. Use the 1st person. $<$GM models$>$


\subsection*{Social and Cultural norms (10 min)}
Now we’re going to work together to create some shared experiences as a cohort. Even if your character hasn’t been here before, you as a player are helping to create these ``norms.'' Assume that someone briefed you before you got here or something.

Please remember to allow others to speak and share the spotlight.  Please raise your hand if you want to share.

\textbf{Reflect Alone:} 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item How involved in national politics are you?
	\item What are your personal feelings about the war? How does this compare to the public stance of your nation?
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Discuss Together:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item How do advisors normally conduct meetings here at the Time of Deciding? How are things likely to be different with the de facto leader, Madrone, not in attendance?  
	\item Are the students and teachers allowed, welcome, or expected/``required'' at the advisor meetings? Only some students or teachers?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Role in the Time of Deciding (5 min)}
Now we’re going to think about our cohort in the Time of Deciding. Reflect to yourself about this. We won't discuss it now, but you may want to talk about it in character later.

\textbf{Is now the time for a new peace treaty? What must a treaty have in order for your character to support it?}

\subsection*{Impact of Magic (10 min)}
And one last thing to reflect on: The impact of Magic in these character’s lives. Collect in groups by nation (within the cohort). I’ll ask each group a question. You’ll have a few minutes to discuss among yourselves, and then share with the larger group.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \pFarm{}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item How does magic enable us to feed the population?
		\item How does healing magic allow us to improve quality of life? (e.g. medicine without magic is non-existent.)
	\end{enumerate}
	\item \pTech{}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item How is magic necessary for technology? (e.g. magic powers all technology; no concept of engines or batteries.)
		\item How does magic support innovation?
	\end{enumerate}
	\item \pShip{}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item How does magic empower us to face the sea serpents? (e.g. non-magical weapons won’t pierce the hide.)
		\item How does magic improve our crafting/building/art?
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Alright, last up is a workshop by nation. Check your manila envelope for which GM you are going to be with next.
