Leaving \cChupGod{} is harder than leaving other Patron Deities. Not that switching among the publicly known patron deities is easy, but it is a fair bit easier when you don’t need to conceal your previous affiliation. As far as everyone outside of the \pGoaties{} is concerned, you are, and have always been, a follower of \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}.

You should not rely upon being welcomed back just because you are leaving the cult. Many would still look upon you with suspicion, or regard you as a criminal. You should also bear in mind that \textbf{you still support the goals of the \pGoaties{},} you just no longer feel able to serve yourself. You \textbf{do not} want to reveal the cult or their plans to anyone. Not that you are particularly clear on this weekends plan. It seems that the leadership forgot who you were before you could be briefed.

Despite it being hard, escaping from the \pGoaties{} is important to you, and you are willing to try to do it. The escape must happen in 3 parts:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Disconnect yourself from \cGenesis{}:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item 
    \item 
    \item 
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Re-ingratiate yourself with \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item 
    \item 
    \item 
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Participate in a conversion ritual.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item You could theoretically use the normal conversion ritual, but there are a lot of complications to it:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item You would need one of the \pGoaties{} to agree to helping you leave, something they will certainly be loath to do.
      \item The Cleric and other participants would learn of the Deific allegiance of both you and the other Follower.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item You could use a \textbf{modified} conversion ritual, \textbf{if} you can convince a Cleric to do it. The modified conversion ritual has the following constraints:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Should take no less than \textbf{5 minutes,} and no more than \textbf{10 minutes.} Requires 1 cleric of \cEbb{} or \cFlow{}, yourself as the person converting, and \textbf{5 people} who already follow \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}.
      \item All participants will feel exhausted after the ritual and should roleplay accordingly for at least 30 minutes.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

The moment the conversion ritual is complete, you will forget the identity of any \pGoaties{} you knew, and anything you knew about their plans. No truth mechanic can recall this information; it has been taken from you by \cGenesis{} \cGenesis{\them}self as both a way to protect their remaining followers, and as a form of punishment for abandoning them. You still remember that \textbf{you} were part of the \pGoaties{}, and that you acted as an avenger, and that is why people close to you started forgetting you over time. 

\textbf{Set your V-Score to Zero (0) once the conversion ritual is complete. You will also lose access to your \aLuck{} ability. Give it to a GM or discard it to the nearest stock.}

You hope this escape is also connected to restoring \cHeadScientist{}’s memories of your time together. See your ``\gRestoringLove{}’’ greensheet for more information.
