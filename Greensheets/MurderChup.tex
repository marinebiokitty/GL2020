The Patron Deities of all three nations agree on 1 rule: No Murder. And you have broken that rule. \cGenesis{} has managed to twist the consequences for \cGenesis{\their} followers who are consecrate Avengers:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Tell a GM that this has happened. They will talk briefly with you about which characters in the game knew your character before the game started - one of them will soon forget you ever existed!
  \item This effect will repeat if you kill again. If you reach a point where no characters who knew you before the game start still remember you, you might cease to exist.
\end{enumerate}

If you could find a way to talk to \cGenesis{} directly, you might be able to plead your case, but otherwise, you are stuck like this.
