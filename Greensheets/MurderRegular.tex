The Patron Deities of all three nations agree on 1 rule: No Murder. And you have broken that rule. The consequences are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item You forget your entire history, and everything you have done up to the moment you killed someone else.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Exception:} You hold onto 1 simple goal of your choice. You lose all context for it, but you continue to care about this 1 thing, almost instinctively. The goal must be simple and straightforward. No convoluted sentences with multiple clauses. (e.g.: ``I will protect this person,’’ ``I must steal that,’’ or ``I must emigrate from my home country.’’)
  \end{enumerate}
  \item You forget everyone you knew. Everyone is now a complete stranger.
  \item Your current and max CR becomes 1 - you have forgotten how to use your magic.
  \item You lose access to all abilities and greensheets you had. (Don’t destroy them, but do put them away)
\end{enumerate}

If you could find a way to talk to the Patron Deities directly, you might be able to plead your case, but otherwise, you are stuck like this.
