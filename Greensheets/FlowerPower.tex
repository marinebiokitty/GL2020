\name{\gFlowerPower{}}

As Nobility of the \pFarm{} with an impeccable bloodline, you have the ability to make soil fertile and plants grow with vigor. While mostly beyond the scope of game, you can occasionally call upon this power to cause extremely rapid growth of a plant. 

If you are in the College Gardens, you may draw items from both the ``The College Gardens By Day'' and ``The College Gardens By Night'' signs \textbf{regardless of the time of day}.

In addition, \textbf{three times per day,} regardless of your location or the time of day, you may cause \textbf{one} flower to grow/appear. Either create the item card yourself with scrap paper, or drop out of character, go to GM HQ, and search the ``\sFlowerPower{}’’ sign for the flower you want to grow.

The flowers you can grow that may be relevant this weekend:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \iBlackCrocus{}
	\item \iFlameOrchid{}
	\item \iHollyhock{}
	\item \iLily{}
	\item \iMoonflower{}
	\item \iNightshade{}
	\item \iMorningGlory{}
\end{itemize}

These flowers are used by cursemakers to brew their curses, are useful at certain in-game locations, and may have other uses. You may wish to advertise to other characters that you have the ability to make them grow on demand.
