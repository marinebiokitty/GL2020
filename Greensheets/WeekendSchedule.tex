\name{\gWeekendSchedule{}}

Below is the full event schedule, including both in game and out of game activities as of 29Jul2024. No IC events are mandatory for players to attend. They are probably good places to find other characters, or good times to sneak off and do something secret. The Pre-Game OOC events \textbf{are} mandatory, for the safety and coherence of the event. Post-game OOC events are optional. However, since these activities affect when carpools can leave, players who are carpooling should be prepared to be on site until 5 pm on Sunday, even if they personally wish to opt out of post game workshops.

Dinner on Friday is OOC, as it occurs before the game begins. Time to mingle and socialize as players is important for building rapport that facilitates intense play. This is also a time to do any in person calibration you and your fellow players deem necessary. Dinner on Saturday is also OOC, to give everyone a break. All other meals are optionally in character for soft RP, or OOC, as players choose. We will designate spaces for IC and OOC in the dining hall if it proves valuable.

This schedule is subject to change between now and game start as in and out of game needs mandate. We will have a final copy of the schedule at game, which will supersede this one if any changes are made.

Locations are listed as OOC locations for OOC activities, and IC locations for IC activities. A labeled site map will be provided before game.

%%%%%%%% Meal times: 8 am, 12 pm, 5:30 pm

For workshops on Friday afternoon, please pack a jacket,sunscreen, and bug spray in an easily accessible place in your car/luggage, we may be outside or inside for these, and you may want to grab one or both.
