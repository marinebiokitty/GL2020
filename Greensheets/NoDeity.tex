You have forsaken your patron deity, and taken no other. In Cengea, this means that you are now subject to the strictures of all of the Patron Deities. Each applies strictures to you that you are bound to.

\textbf{Demands} are things you cannot resist; your character is bound to do this.\\
\textbf{Suggestions} are things that you can do, but will make you feel miserable afterwards for 5-10 minutes as the deity in question frowns upon your conduct.
