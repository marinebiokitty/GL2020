\name{\gStormSurgeInside{}}

If you are unable to take shelter inside a bunker during one of the 3 storm surges, consult the nearest one of these signs to see what consequences (if any) you suffer. Different areas have slightly different risk of consequences.

You must also roll a D20 to see if you suffer any consequences. Because this is an IC indoor space, you get to add +1 to your rollIf your V-score = 1, roll twice and take the higher.

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|>{\centering\arraybackslash} | >{\centering\arraybackslash} |}
\hline
  {\large What you Roll +1} & {\large Consequence}  \\
\hline
  \textbf{2 - 4} & Struck deaf or blind (playerâ€™s choice) for 5 minutes starting at the end of the storm surge.  \\
\hline
  \textbf{5- 7} & Minus 1 CR until the next meal. Drop one of your CR stones in the nearest stock to remind you of this.  \\
\hline
  \textbf{8- 10} & Lose a random item (give it to a GM).  \\
\hline
 \textbf{20} & Gain +1 CR until the next meal. Pick up an extra CR stone from the nearest stock to remind you of this.  \\
