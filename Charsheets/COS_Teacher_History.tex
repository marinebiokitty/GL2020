\name{\cHistory{}}

You are \cHistory{\full} (\cHistory{\they}/\cHistory{\them}) and comfortably middle aged. You teach History at the \pSchool{}, helping to shape new minds while simultaneously secretly managing \cQueen{\Their} Majesty's spy network. It's not \emph{exactly} that your loyalties are split, but it would be wrong to say that after over fifteen years at the \pSchool{} you have completely avoided becoming a little attached to the place. The students here need guidance, the \pSc{} needs maintenance, and sometimes international politics needs a swift kick in the rear. It is a busy life, but you are good at it, you enjoy it, and the duplicity feels so natural at this point that you hardly notice the qualms.

You are the firstborn \cHistory{\child} of a middlingly powerful noble family in the \pFarm{}. You wanted for little growing up, and navigated the viper's nest of Court with aplomb. You attended university and majored in history, which you genuinely enjoyed. Your thesis was a treatise on the creation story. Your life's ambition was to teach at a \pFarm{} university for a few years before marrying well and settling down on your family's estate to raise a family. Sure enough, you landed a history professorship at a prestigious university, and all seemed to be going according to plan. That is, until your teaching credentials and skill at courtly intrigue brought you to the attention of the most powerful people in the country, including \cQueen{\full} \cQueen{\themself}. In a heartbeat, your perfect life was swept aside in favor of the needs of the nation.

A position at the \pSchool{} was quickly arranged for you. At first, it was simply in exchange for small reports on the activities of your fellow teachers, sent home clandestinely. Then came a request for a verbal report, made to \cQueen{\Their} Majesty directly. And then it was private conferences with the \cQueen{\Majesty}, time spent advising \cQueen{\them} on matters of national importance. It was always in private and unofficial, of course -- but it occurred with rapidly increasing frequency. Before you really knew how it happened, you were your \cQueen{\Majesty}'s personal spymaster. Sure, there is an official state spymaster -- but you answer to the \cQueen{\Majesty} alone. If this became known, at best you would simply lose your job. Teachers are supposed to be neutral entities, teaching all students equally, and to benefit of all three nations. At worst, you would be struck down in secret by the nobles of your own nation, or by jealous rivals in other nations who could finally strike at you with your mask removed. 

You therefore took it very seriously when recent intelligence reports suggested the presence of two other clandestine operatives at the school this weekend. If the reports are correct, a spy from the \pTech{} will be here this weekend among the advisors, and another spy of unknown nationality has been operating here among the teachers for some time. You've long suspected the latter, as you recognize the fingerprints of another operative at work even if you can't pin down who it is. Given the pivotal events happening this weekend, you would not be surprised if the L'eau have a spy here as well, but that is just a hunch. You'll have to stay on your toes, and make sure these other operatives don't find you or do anything to interfere with your objectives.

In service to your cover as a teacher, and in honor of your first love (History), you do your best with the students. Not all young minds start out eager to learn, but every class has one or two who really take to it. While your expertise is in the history of \pFarm{}, you teach the history of all of \pEarth{}. You have a lot of hope for \cLibAssist{\full}, but otherwise the current crop of students is a little disappointing. \cLibAssist{} has a cunning mind that is quite skilled at seeing flaws in plans. You have been delighted to support \cLibAssist{\them} as best you can without seeming to play favorites. The easiest way to do that this weekend is by influencing the \pTech{} teachers to rank \cLibAssist{} the highest for voting authority and to a lesser extent, convincing the \pFarm{} advisors to do the same.

But your influence extends well beyond the school these days, and you can potentiall offer \cLibAssist{} much more. Realizing that you needed an agent among the students and recognizing \cLibAssist{}'s potential, you recruited \cLibAssist{\them} a year ago to be your spy and informant, and \cLibAssist{\they} \cLibAssist{\have} not disappointed. The more valuable intelligence \cLibAssist{\they} brings you, the more strings you will be able to pull with the \cQueen{\Majesty} to see that \cLibAssist{} goes far in life, \cLibAssist{\their} lowborn status notwithstanding. The most recent tidbit \cLibAssist{\they} shared with you is the mysterious disappearance and reappearance of the \iScythe{} from the library a few weeks ago, seemingly without anyone else noticing. Troubling, and intriguing.

The students aside, the \pSc{} is a marvel unto itself. The floating island on which it is built is unique -- it is sustained by the ley lines, which need to be maintained with the utmost care. You've watched that ritual before, always led by the principal, and have contemplated participating in the past -- but always decided against it, due to the price; still, some part of you wonders if this might be the year to help out. It is obvious to you, and anyone else who has studied the phenomenon, that the ley lines need the island to stay together as much as the island needs the ley lines to float. If something were to happen to the island -- a.k.a. if it were destroyed -- the proximity of so much intense magical energy, unshielded by the rocks and dirt of the island, would shred the fragile ley lines in a matter of hours. With the ley lines severed, all magic would stagnate, trapped like an insect in amber. Only the Deities themselves could repair the damage - but without magic, how would the people of \pEarth{} even appeal to the Gods for help? Worse, without magic, people would starve and die in droves – no food, no medicine, no protection from sea serpents, no technology. You shudder to even think of it.

The Library at the \pSc{} is a wonder of architecture and magic. In it are stored some of the most rare and valuable tomes in all of \pEarth{}, which you count yourself lucky for the opportunity to study whenever you want, as well as many magical artifacts. These priceless pieces are stored here because, while the storm rages around the island as it's power builds, the storm never strikes the school -- so things stored here are protected in a way that no other place on \pEarth{} is. For this weekend, the most important are the Relics. The Relics can be attuned to one of the three nations, and 3 of them must be used in the ritual to control the Storm. The integrity of the Relics is the purview of the priests, and the design of the ritual is the responsibility of the students, but the necessary preparations for the Ritual fall to the teachers. You've helped \cLibrarian{\full} with this in the past, and found \cLibrarian{\them} quite pleasant to work with. You look forward to helping with this duty again this weekend. 

The third noteworthy part of the school are the Bunkers. These marvels of engineering provide a way to protect the people who stay at the school during the Storm Surges. An advisor named \cBunker{\full} built them several decades ago, and comes by every six years to look in on them. While you haven't met \cBunker{\them} in person too many times, you've maintained a casual correspondence, and found quite the kindred spirit. \cBunker{} is a most gifted architect, and has a keen mind for current affairs.

But with a war on, maybe anyone with any sense of self preservation has a keen interest in current affairs. Six years ago, the \pFarm{} and \pTech{} signed a treaty that completely screwed over the \pShippies{}. The storm was directed to the \pShip{}, instead of the \pTech{} that year in the most momentous stab in the back of the modern era. And then the children who were voting to direct that storm were killed. That detail irked you. How could you have not been told that was part of the plan? Obviously you would have tried to persuade people to find another way, but that was not sufficient grounds to cut you out of that particular piece of intelligence. The \cQueen{\Majesty} had even gone so far as to order you to not stay at the \pSc{} for the Time of Deciding that year, so you were not present for the incident. Though \cQueen{\they} claimed it was to avoid any possible suspicion landing on you, a part of you peevishly wonders if it was also to keep you from interfering. This incident convinced you that you needed to turn more attention to what was going on at home. You recalled some of your agents and began to place them within the \pFarm{} in hopes of never being caught unaware like that again. One need not be a diligent student of history to predict the war that followed the betrayal. And thus you were confronted with the question: is there ever such a thing as a just war?

At first the question seemed moot. Your nation was at war. The \cQueen{\Majesty} was for it. Therefore, you were obligated to help. You passed what information you could, although a small but not insignificant number of reports from your birdies started to look a little odd. Still, you had a war to win. Until one day, only a few weeks ago, you got a letter from \cQueen{\Majesty} \cQueen{} \cQueen{\themself}. It was written in your own personal code that only the two of you know, and in it was the most unexpected news: The \cQueen{\Majesty} is actually against continuing the war! \cQueen{\They} had thought long and hard, seen the toll the war had taken, and finally decided to change \cQueen{\their} stance. \cQueen{\They} ordered you to keep this information secret for both national and international reasons for now. To show \cQueen{\their} hand too soon could alienate the \pTech{} before a defensive alliance could be formed with the \pShip{} (if a treaty between all three nations proves out of reach). To make it publicly known that \cQueen{\they} changed \cQueen{\their} mind would also be seen as a weakness in the eyes of various \pFarm{} noble families, which could easily lead to a civil war and the loss of even more lives.

The \cQueen{\Majesty} wants a treaty, ideally one without too many painful reparations, but as long as it involves protection from retaliation by the \pTech{}, \cQueen{\they} support it. Naturally, this comes with the caveat that the \pFarm{} are not remotely prepared to receive the Storm this year. They might be willing to do so in the future, but not this year; the cost of life and destruction to the harvest (and consequently most of the food supply for the whole continent) would be tremendous. It falls to you to influence the negotiations in favor of a treaty without revealing \cQueen{\Their} Majesty's position on the matter. \cEvil{} carries the official public responsibility for negotiating at the treaty table, but as an absolute last resort, you have a letter of authority from the \cQueen{\Majesty}. This would allow you to reveal your authority and rank and speak on \cQueen{\their} Majesty's behalf -- but only if you cannot accomplish your ends in a more subtle way. You hope that \cEvil{}'s tendency to get bored at meetings will provide you the opportunity to take charge without a power struggle or having to tip your hand.

The \cQueen{\Majesty} also tasked you some time ago with keeping an eye on \cQueen{\their} youngest \cPrince{\child} and (secretly) favored heir to the throne, \cPrince{\full}, who teaches Curse Breaking at the College of the Gods. It's really quite unfortunate that the \cPrince{\Heir} is mixed up with commoner magic as it contributes to \cPrince{\their} lack of popularity among many of the nobles. The young \cPrince{\heir} generally keeps \cPrince{\their} nose clean, but there are two items which have caught your attention. The first is \cPrince{}'s romance with \cPirate{\full}, the Shop and Crafting teacher at the college. \cPirate{} hails from the \pShip{}, an enemy nation, is not a noble, and records of \cPirate{\their} activities prior to arriving at the college 18 years ago are not corroborated anywhere outside of \cPirate{\their} application to teach at the college. You suspect they are forged, but have been unable to verify this. In short, \cPirate{\theyare} not a suitable match for a \cPrince{\heir}, and \cPrince{} doesn't seem to care. Of equally great concern, one month ago, the \cQueen{\Majesty} lent \cPrince{} one of the two royal signet rings and tasked \cPrince{\them} with bringing it to Duke \cChupStudent{\formal}, father to \cChupStudent{\full} (one of the students), in order to use it to approve a piece of legislation the Duke had drafted. The assignment should only have taken a week or two at most, but \cPrince{} has yet to return the signed and sealed legislation, and the signet ring, to the \cQueen{\Majesty}. The prince is obviously stalling, and it falls to you to find out why. 

As if you didn't have enough to deal with, you are also tasked with investigating a radical religious cult that has been rabble rousing and stirring up outright sedition among your nation's lowborn peasants, malcontents, and youth. The symbol of this enigmatic cult, who call themselves the \pGoaties{}, is a four-leaf clover. While most of your knowledge comes from the \pFarm{}, you have reason to believe that the cult has been operating internationally for at least a few years. Given how quickly the cult has spread and the destabilizing effect it is having on your nation, you suspect that it is backed by the \pShip{} in an effort to tip the balance of the war, though you have no hard evidence yet to support that theory. What you do have evidence of, in the form of a recently intercepted letter, is that the \pGoaties{} have an agent among the \pFarm{} students at the \pSchool{}. The operative question is of course, ``why?'' Given the delicate treaty negotiations, the ritual to direct the Storm, and the vulnerability of the ley lines, it doesn't take much imagination to see that they could cause a great deal of damage if they so chose. You'd best figure out what they're up to, and fast; if only there had been time to assemble dossiers on all four suspects. \cLibAssist{}, at least, is beyond suspicion; you vetted \cLibAssist{\them} carefully when you first took \cLibAssist{\them} on as an informant. That is not to say that \cLibAssist{\their} hands are entirely clean — \cLibAssist{\theyare} clearly a messenger for the Black Market -- a detail \cLibAssist{\they} \cLibAssist{\have} yet to admit to you — but you're confident \cLibAssist{\theyare} not a \pGoatie{} at least. Your suspects are therefore the other three \pFarm{} students: \cChupStudent{\full}, \cAdopted{\full}, and \cDisney{\full}.

This weekend you expect to be quite busy doing all the things you do best. You have truths to uncover, both for an accurate historical record, and to the advantage of your \cQueen{\Majesty}. You have children, relics, and priceless tomes to protect. And you have a war to end without your involvement being noticed. Good thing you are up to the challenge.

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Investigate the \pGoaties{} and disrupt anything they might be plotting. The letter you intercepted suggests one of their operatives is a student from the \pFarm{}.
	\item Be the \cQueen{\Majesty}'s voice in the treaty negotiations, advocating for a treaty and end to the war, without revealing \cQueen{\Their} Majesty's position. Any treaty should ensure that the Storm not be sent to your nation at this Time of Deciding, as the consequences would be devastating.
	\item Act as the \cQueen{\Majesty}'s spymaster and collect as much information as you can that might benefit \cQueen{\them} and your nation. Intelligence reports suggest that the \pTech{} has a spy here this weekend among the advisors, and that a rival \pFarm{} spy is here among the teachers.
	\item Keep an eye on \cPrince{}. Find a way to disrupt \cPrince{\their} romance with \cPirate{}, who is an unsuitable match for the \cPrince{\heir}. Find out why \cPrince{\they} \cPrince{\have} not returned the \cQueen{\Majesty}'s signet ring and documents from Duke \cChupStudent{\formal}.
	\item Work with \cLibrarian{} to prepare the ritual to control the Storm and make sure nothing happens to the Relics needed for the ritual.
	\item Support \cLibAssist{} by encouraging the \pTech{} teachers and \pFarm{} advisors to rank \cLibAssist{\them} the highest for voting authority; in return, continue to leverage \cLibAssist{\their} abilities as your spy among the students.
	\item Investigate the deaths of the students who directed the Storm six years ago. You don't know who ordered their assassination, but you don't approve of their methods, nor do you appreciate being cut out of the planning.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You are the history teacher at the College of the Gods.
	\item You were ordered by the \cQueen{\Majesty} not to be here six years ago when the students who directed the Storm at the \pShippies{} out of turn all died suddenly. You suspect a coverup on the part of your nation and the \pTech{}.
	\item Pirates are a frequent concern for your nation, and as the \cQueen{\Majesty}'s personal spymaster, you naturally know some of their goings-on. Pirates often use code phrases that refer to to the graveyard where their ships hide as ``untouched waters,'' tools related to navigation, and ``charting courses''. Anyone using such language is to be viewed with deep suspicion of being a pirate.
	\item The Order of the Black Crocus is, or rather was, a secret international law enforcement entity with jurisdiction across all three nations. As far as you know, it splintered into factions when the war started, each faction subsumed by the intelligence services of its corresponding nation. You are sometimes nostalgic for the spirit of international collaboration that fueled the group and the contributions it made to peace and security, but on the other hand, you certainly don't miss their meddling in your and the \cQueen{\Majesty}'s affairs.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cLibrarian{}} The ultimate authority on the Ritual to Control the Storm. \cLibrarian{\Theyare} very competent and pleasant to work with.
	\contact{\cBunker{}} The genius behind the bunkers, and an excellent conversationalist with whom you've kept up a casual correspondence.
	\contact{\cEvil{}} \cEvil{} is the public voice of the \cQueen{\Majesty} at the treaty talks, and a ruthless political broker in \cEvil{\their} own right. \cEvil{\They} seem to be very strongly pro-war, but it is also possible to prey on \cEvil{\their} tendency to get bored of international politics (\cEvil{\They} prefer the intrigue of the Royal Court). Manipulating \cEvil{\them} may prove necessary.
	\contact{\cLibAssist{}} Your most promising student. You might make a protégé of \cLibAssist{\them} yet, if \cLibAssist{\they} \cLibAssist{\does}n't insist on becoming a librarian. Currently acting as your spy and informant among the students.
	\contact{\cPrince{}} The \cQueen{\Majesty}'s youngest \cPrince{\child} and favored heir, whom you are charged with monitoring.
