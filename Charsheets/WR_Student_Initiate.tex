\name{\cInitiate{}}

You are \cInitiate{\full} (\cInitiate{\they}/\cInitiate{\them}) and a student at the \pSchool{}. At 22 years old you are an Initiate in the priesthood of \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}, with a life of meaning and devotion ahead of you. You have a passion for crafting and engineering as well, but religion is your first love. You are from the \pShip{}, but your parents ran away from the \pFarm{} before you were born and that history has made your life\ldots{} complicated of late. With the help of your best friend, \cPresident{\full}, there is a lot you intend to accomplish at the Time of Deciding this weekend.

You were born in the 2nd fleet and grew up alongside \cPresident{}. For many years, the two of you did everything together, including moving to Drova's Landing, a town in 1st Fleet — until the time came to go to academy. You went to the 1st fleet academy to study religion with the intent to enter the priesthood, while \cPresident{\they} went to 2nd fleet academy, to study politics and diplomacy. Reunited by the Goddesses' own good fortune with your best friend here at the \pSchool{}, the two of you are unstoppable!

Unstoppable, that is, except for the bad luck. Three months ago, you received ``\iCursedLetter{}'' from your long lost family, the Fairweathers, in the \pFarm{}. They demanded your immediate return to the \pFarm{} to take your rightful place in the family and continue the bloodline. You had no such inclination to do so initially -- your immediate family immigrated to the \pShip{} to escape these people before you were even born, after all, so you have no connection or interest in them beyond the last generation's bad blood. However, the bargaining chip that the letter spoke of, a curse of bad luck, was inflicted on you by the letter itself — and its continued influence on your life has begun to wear you down. You trip and drop things frequently. You lose objects that you cherish, like the holy symbol your mother gave you when you left home to study as a cleric. On one occasion, an errant gust of wind blew an essay you had just finished writing for class into the fireplace and you had to start all over!

You regularly stay up late talking with \cPresident{} and \cWarlordDaughter{\full}, another initiate to the priesthood who is here at the school, about what to do. \cWarlordDaughter{} is surprisingly sentimental for someone who is the \cWarlordDaughter{\child} of \cLoud{\full}, the warlord who started and leads the \pShip{} war effort. \cWarlordDaughter{\They} often encourage\cWarlordDaughter{\plural} you to at least give your family in the \pFarm{} a chance. \cPresident{}, on the other hand, is convinced that if you went to your grandparents' place they would never let you leave. With their heavy handed efforts to get you back, you certainly see his point. Either way, you've got to get rid of this curse somehow! Then you can figure out if you want to go visit your grandparents. 

The cursemaker teacher at the \pSchool{} says there is no way to break a bad luck curse; the only thing one can do is fulfill the requirements to end it that were stipulated in its creation - aka go to the Fairweather estate. Your investigations with \cPresident{} and \cWarlordDaughter{} haven't turned up much in terms of other leads, except a few errant whispers about a hidden group that follows a Deity of Luck instead of one of the Patron Deities. Maybe they could help you, if you could find them.

There's another important decision to make this weekend – you've been putting off picking a path for your priesthood. You will need to pick one Goddess to primarily serve, and with both \cEbbPriest{\full}, a \cEbbPriest{\cleric} of \cEbbFull{\full}, and \cFlowPriest{\full}, a \cFlowPriest{\cleric} of \cFlowFull{\full}, here this weekend, it's a pretty good opportunity. In fact, if you end up deciding to return to your extended family, it may be your ONLY opportunity. And, as a side benefit, it would be really nice to have access to the full range of power that a \cInitiate{\cleric} has. It is a tough decision. Further, while you think it is great that \cEbbPriest{} is a ``full time cleric,'' fully devoted to \cEbb{}'s work, you really want a life more like \cFlowPriest{\full}'s. \cFlowPriest{} has a job as a teacher, as well as \cFlowPriest{\their} cleric duties. You'd love to be able to continue to follow your passion for engineering even after you join the priesthood. But that particular concern is independent of the decision on which path to choose.

\cFlowPriest{} recently confided in you that something terrible had happened that could also affect your plans to join the priesthood – the Avatar of \cEbb{} had been murdered! Setting aside the dire implications for the \pShip{} as a nation, on a more personal level, without the \cEbb{} Avatar alive and well, your only choice is the path of \cFlow{}. While \cFlow{} isn't a bad choice, you would like to actually be able to \textbf{choose}. That's why, when \cFlowPriest{} came to you with a surprising opportunity to resurrect the Avatar, you were excited to help. You just hope you can be of assistance in this important secret quest!

Before you get too lost in your future, though, it's worth engaging with the opportunities of the present. Chief among these is the chance to study with \cBunker{\full} when \cBunker{\they} arrive\cBunker{\plural} with the \pShip{} delegation to inspect the Bunkers that keep people safe from the Storm Surges at the \pSc{}. The wonderful thing about \pShippie{} magic is the craftsmanship, and you don't want to pass up a chance to see such an engineering marvel in action. \cBunker{} is primarily a follower of \textcolor{red}{\cEbb{}} \sout{\cFlow{}} -- engineering is a lot about knowing \textcolor{red}{when to remove the stints and supports} \sout{how to start things}. You really want to get \cBunker{\their} perspective on everything from life, to engineering, to the priesthood.

You also intend to look out for what is best for the \pShip{}. You plan to keep an eye on, and take a hand in, setting up the Ritual to Control the Storm. You care for your homeland, and by making sure the ritual is arranged correctly, you can ensure no one is up to anything shady that might screw over the \pShippies{} again. You don't really care which students get the most votes to direct the Storm, as long as they direct it away from the \pShip{}. Helping with the Ritual will also be a good opportunity to work directly with \cEbbPriest{} and \cFlowPriest{} and observe how their different callings cause them to approach situations differently.

Aside from your own plans, you are happy to support \cPresident{} in \cPresident{\theirs}. \cPresident{} is looking into what happened to the students six years ago, when the Storm was sent out of turn the first time. You suspect that investigation might end up requiring\ldots{} religious support, but without any way to guess which adults were involved in that mess, you're a much safer option -- hopefully the power you have as an initiate will be enough. Your sense of camaraderie with \cPresident{} even goes so far as to wing\cInitiate{\person} for them in matters of romantic attraction. This being \cPresident{}'s last year at the \pSc{} too, \cPresident{\they} \cPresident{\have} left it a little late, but such is the way of things. You think that \cPresident{} could make a good couple with either of their current crushes: \cHeir{\full} or \cChupStudent{\full} - or both of them! You just have to figure out how to get them all to open up to each other about their feelings. And deal with \cHeir{} and \cChupStudent{} being resistant to polyamory of course; neither of their home nations condone it.

Maybe romance is just in the air. You unintentionally learned that the Art teacher, \cChupAvenger{\full}, is having romantic problems of \cChupAvenger{\their} own. \cEbb{} and \cFlow{} encourage their followers to give their prayers to the sea breeze, which will carry the prayer to the ears of the Goddesses. Unfortunately, this sometimes means that other mortals overhear too. \cChupAvenger{}'s prayer to have \cHeadScientist{\full} remember their romance was carried to your ears. Maybe it was just coincidence, or maybe the Goddesses have sent you to be their instrument, and to help these two get back together. You are a little cautious about approaching the situation, since \cChupAvenger{} might not want help from a student, and it all begs the question of what \cHeadScientist{} did to lose part of \cHeadScientist{\their} memories. But on the other hand, how wonderful would it be to help these two restore their relationship? As with many problems, the best place to start researching is probably the Library! Maybe the Librarian has some ideas? 

So this weekend is going to be busy. You have a lot of decisions to make about your own future, the future of your nation to protect, and the future of your friends to help build. Which Goddess will you choose to serve? Will \cPresident{} or \cChupAvenger{} find romance? And will you manage to break the bad luck curse without being forced to acquiesce to your \pFarm{} family's demands?

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Work with \cPresident{} and \cWarlordDaughter{} to find the followers of a Deity of Luck and see if they can help you break the Bad Luck Curse. Then decide whether you are going to visit your extended family in the \pFarm{}.
	\item Help the teachers prepare for the Ritual to Control the Storm, and make sure the Storm gets sent somewhere other than the \pShip{}.
	\item Choose your cleric's path, whether it be \cEbbFull{\full}, \cFlowFull{\full}, or the very difficult path of Balance, and have your promotion ceremony to full \cInitiate{\cleric}. Help \cFlowPriest{} and \cEbbPriest{} secretly resurrect the \cEbb{} avatar. Without it, you cannot choose to follow \cEbb{}'s path.
	\item Hang out with \cBunker{} and do your best to assist \cBunker{\them} in maintaining the bunkers.
	\item Help \cPresident{} out with \cPresident{\their} investigations into what happend 6 years ago, and if you can get \cPresident{\them} to put work aside for a minute, help \cPresident{\them} approach \cHeir{} and/or \cChupStudent{} as potential romantic partners.
	\item Help \cChupAvenger{} out with getting \cHeadScientist{} to regain \cHeadScientist{\their} memories of \cChupAvenger{}.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You are graduating this year.
	\item Your lost holy symbol was a ring with two sea serpents entwined, each swallowing the others tail.

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cPresident{}} Your best friend. Accomplished and confident - yet sometimes you wonder if \cPresident{\they} would be able to accomplish anything without your help.
	\contact{\cWarlordDaughter{}} A fellow initiate of the Goddesses. Great for late night chats about the meaning of life.
	\contact{\cBunker{}} The chief engineer who designed the bunkers that protect people at the school as the storm intensifies of the weekend. You are so excited to study with them during the regular check of the bunkers.
	\contact{\cFlowPriest{}} A \cFlowPriest{\cleric} of \cFlow{} and teacher at the school. \cFlowPriest{\They} \cFlowPriest{\have} a flexible and open minded interpretation of the faith.
	\contact{\cEbbPriest{}} A \cEbbPriest{\cleric} of \cEbb{}, an advisor at the school this weekend, and a full time \cEbbPriest{\cleric}. \cEbbPriest{} has a somewhat stricter and more ``by the book'' interpretation of the faith.
	\contact{\cChupAvenger{}} A teacher whose love, \cHeadScientist{}, has forgotten \cChupAvenger{\them}. You want to help if you can!
