So you started looking for a way out. Contingency plans are always good. Still, you wouldn’t have expected the church to be your solution. When \cBeetle{} wrote to you a few months back inviting you to study with \cBeetle{\them}, you brushed the invitation off. But now that you think of it, if you were a \cHeadScientist{\cleric} of \cTechGod{}, you’d be somewhat protected from the legal system of the \pTech{}. Of course, \cBeetle{}’s position is only available if \cBeetle{\they} are selected as the next principal of the \pSc{}. And 57 is a little late to enter the game -- you’ll have to work very, very hard to convince \cAntiChup{} and \cBeetle{} that you actually want to become a \HeadScientist{\cleric}, and are suited to the role.
