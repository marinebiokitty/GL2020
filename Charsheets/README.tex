%% Character sheets live in this directory.  This file doubles as a
%% latex'able example charsheet.
%%
%% _template.tex serves as a bare-bones template suitable for
%% copying when starting a new sheet.
%%
%% Character macros (in ../Lists/char-LIST.tex, presumably) each
%% have a file that lives here.  The argument to \name{...} probably
%% should be the macro for the given character, which will generate
%% the charsheet's name (and print out lists of the characters stuff
%% at the end) as specified in char-LIST.tex.  However, you can also
%% just use \name{Some Text} if you want.

%% \TODO outputs to the page and the terminal.  It is used for
%% reminders of future work, and a convenient way to build a short
%% outline for a sheet in-progress.
\TODO{This is a test character sheet.}

%% Using a Char macro with an empty argument, like \cTest{\intro}, will
%% produce the \usual namemapping (see Extras/README-namemappings).
%% Introduce a character with \intro, e.g. \cTest{\intro}, to get a
%% more full name.  \intro can be used whenever it fits into the text
%% flow.
Your friend from out of town, \cSomeGuy{\intro}, called you up one
morning about a week ago.  \cSomeGuy{} told you to meet up with this
person named \cNPC{\intro}, whom you've never met.  \cNPC{}, whose full name
is \cNPC{\intro}, is supposed to be really awesome and have a package
for you.

%% You can skip the advanced namemapping commands, and instead use
%% \full, \fullplain (full name without prefixes or suffixes),
%% \formal, and \informal.  You can also nest these inside identities,
%% such as \nick{} (see Extras/README-identity).
That bears repeating: \cNPC{\nick{\informal}}, whose full name is
\cNPC{\full}, is supposed to be really awesome and have a package for
you.

%% For pronouns and other gender-dependent words, you can use the
%% pronoun commands defined in Lists/char-LIST.tex to automatically
%% control them based on the character's gender.  For example,
%% \cTest{\They} will produce He, She, It, or He/She, based on
%% \cTest's \MYsex field.  You can define your own pronouns in
%% Lists/char-LIST.tex, as well.
\cSomeGuy{} is a pretty good friend.  \cSomeGuy{\They} used to be your
college roommate.  When \cSomeGuy{\they} called you up, you were
pleasently surprised to hear from \cSomeGuy{\them}.

%% \me{} produces whatever the argument to \name{...} is.  If, like
%% usual, the argument was a char Macro, \me{} is an alias for that
%% macro.
Lots of people think your name, \me{\intro}, is funny.  You're not
sure why; you think it's a fine name.

%% The itemz environment is a list environment similar to itemize.
%% The typesetting is very tight, and matches that used by the lists
%% at the end of character sheets.  It takes an optional argument that
%% acts as a title for the list.  The enum environment is a similar
%% variation of the enumerate environment, and the desc environment is
%% similar to description.
\begin{itemz}[Goals]
  \item Things to do
  \item Governments to topple
  \item Worlds to dominate

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
  \item You were born in London.
