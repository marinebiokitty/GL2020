\name{\cWarlordDaughter{}}

You are \cWarlordDaughter{\full} (\cWarlordDaughter{\they}/\cWarlordDaughter{\them}). You are the \cWarlordDaughter{\child} of \cLoud{\full}, and that makes life\ldots{} complicated. You love your country and your family, but you are ready to chart your own course out of their shadow.

Your life growing up was simple and full of love. You grew up on an unusually stable ship with very little turnover in the crew. You know that \cLoud{} is your biological \cLoud{\parent} and has been with \cQuiet{\full} since before you were born, a rarity in \pShip{}. Your parents encouraged your interest in the Priesthood and supported your desire to attend the 1st fleet academy to study.

Then the storm hit the \pShip{} out of turn. It was a complete disaster. Your ship, Black Crow of the 10th Fleet, nearly sank, and you lost more than half of your crew - your family. Not long after, \cLoud{} began to talk of revenge. Of balancing the scales. Of war. War was a scary prospect, but you understood the need for balance - after all, it is the \pShippies{} way of life. What was weird was that \cLoud{} was advocating for it. \cLoud{\They} \cLoud{\were} always the calm, quiet, patient sort. \cLoud{\They} never resorted to violence if there was another way. And then overnight, bloody vengeance was all \cLoud{\they} could talk about. Something was clearly wrong, but you couldn't figure out what amidst the rising tide of a nation mobilizing for war.

In the wake of this change, your dreams of attending 1st Fleet Academy evaporated. You traveled with the remains of Black Crow, helping \cLoud{} whip up the support \cLoud{\they} needed to convince the Council of Stormwatchers. As time went on, you saw less and less of your parents. Your quiet, happy life was gone. Even what remained of your family was gone. Once the war started in earnest, \cQuiet{} convinced \cLoud{} that you would be safer at a school. The fact that nearly everyone in \pShip{} knew your name as the \cWarlordDaughter{\child} of \cLoud{} made you a shoo-in to attend \pSchool{}. It was supposed to be an honor, but you couldn't help feeling like they had sent you away.

Now you are here, in your second year at the \pSchool{}. Even though you aren't graduating, there are a lot of things weighing on your shoulders. Everyone expects you to be like, speak for, or reject \cLoud{}. They watch your every move like ospreys. You are consulted regularly by both well meaning and manipulative advisors seeking to know \cLoud{}'s mind. You will of course comport yourself with all the dignity required of the \cWarlordDaughter{\child} of \cLoud{\full}, but you don't actually \textbf{want} to spend all day in stuffy meetings. You are sick of being seen as a stand-in for your \cLoud{\parent}, and are determined to chart your own course.

Part one of charting your own course is winning the highest voting authority to direct the Storm. Since the teachers, advisors, and the Goddesses themselves are all involved in awarding voting authority, there is tremendous prestige in being the student granted the most votes to cast. Prestige that would elevate anyone on their own merits. Prestige that will last long after you graduate and return to the \pShip{}! Prestige aside, you wouldn't mind the peace of mind that having more votes would provide you, with regards to the ability to protect your home by sending the Storm elsewhere.

Part two of being recognized as your own person is being chosen as the student speaker for the Ceremony of Excellence. \cMusic{\full} is in charge of organizing the ceremony this year, so you'll need to convince \cMusic{\them} to pick you to give the speech. It is not unusual for an underclassman to be chosen for this and it would make a great first platform to distinguish your views from your \cLoud{\parent}. You are pro justice, fairness, and reparations. War is one way to accomplish that, but it's complicated, messy, and rife with consequences. That's something that \cLoud{} used to understand - it's something that \cLoud{\they} taught you! You want your \cLoud{\parent} back the way \cLoud{\they} \cLoud{\were}. What ever happened to change \cLoud{\them} so?

In search of the answer, you've searched the upper levels of the library countless times, to no avail. But during the Time of Deciding, many areas of the library that are not normally accessible can be reached. It'll be dangerous, and you shouldn't go alone, but maybe, just maybe, you can find something this weekend! The matter is urgent. The looks some of these advisors from other nations give you makes your skin crawl, and you're sure some of them mean you harm. Or if not you, then your \cLoud{\parent}, \cLoud{}. You are particularly concerned about the leaders of the \pTech{} and \pFarm{} advisors, \cDiplomat{\full} and \cEvil{\full} respectively. They both have reputations for being ruthless political players, and were instrumental in the Betrayal of the \pShip{}. You would not be surprised if they are up to something nefarious at this very moment. You have to figure out what happened to \cLoud{} \textbf{this weekend}, and find a way to reverse it. This is so important, and you've been struggling with it for so long!

If only \cHeadDiplomat{\full}, the head diplomat of the Wave Riders, was here! The few times your paths have crossed at official functions, you've found \cHeadDiplomat{\them} to be an incredibly soothing presence. You hope that \cHeadDiplomat{\their} apprentice, \cJuniorStatesman{\full}, is similar. Maybe it is worth approaching \cJuniorStatesman{\them} for help with finding out what happened to your \cLoud{\parent}? And if \cJuniorStatesman{\theyare} one of the many warmongers in charge of your country these days, maybe you can at least talk \cJuniorStatesman{\them} down from it. Or maybe you can turn to your favorite teacher, \cEthics{\full}, who teaches Ethics and Morality. In the last few months, you've found \cEthics{\them} more accessible than usual, and \cEthics{\they} might be a good resource, or at least a friendly ear, as you try to work this all out.

You also have a close confidante in \cHeir{\full}. \cHeir{\They} \cHeir{\have} been such a good friend to you and you tell each other almost everything. Since \cHeir{} is the scion of a powerful \pTech{} family, it took you a while to decide to trust \cHeir{\them}, but you are glad you did. \cHeir{\Theyare} an immense source of support for you, and you for \cHeir{\them}. You know that \cHeir{} doesn't actually want the empire \cHeir{\theyare} supposed to inherit. \cHeir{} knows that \cLoud{} is acting out of character by leading the war effort, and has been trying to help you find out what happened to \cLoud{\them}, so far to no avail.

Maybe \cEbb{} or \cFlow{} themselves could help? You've prayed to them before, but this weekend you will have clerics of both paths at the \pSc{}. You could pick a path, and become a full fledged \cWarlordDaughter{\cleric} yourself. Maybe then the Goddesses would hear your prayer and act. Becoming a \cWarlordDaughter{\cleric} is an involved and life-changing process, but ever since you came up with the idea, you've been committed to this path. Working the will of the Goddesses through your own hands feels right, in a way that nothing else has since \cLoud{} started rabble-rousing. And doing this would be one more way to step out of \cLoud{\their} shadow.

Speaking of careers as a \cWarlordDaughter{\cleric} - there is another initiate at the \pSchool{} who may also be looking to pick a path this weekend. \cInitiate{} is from 2nd fleet, and is the sort that drips privilege. \cInitiate{\They} \cInitiate{\does}n't mean any harm by it, but sometimes \cInitiate{\they} \cInitiate{\are} completely clueless. \cInitiate{} has family in \pFarm{} - family going back for generations. What you wouldn’t give to have a family like that. One you could rely on. One that would go to such immense lengths to get you back. One that didn’t switch personalities over night\ldots Is it weird to wish someone wanted you around so badly that they would send a curse across national borders to get you back?

Okay, so maybe the curse was a little much - or a lot much. You should help \cInitiate{} figure out a way to remove it. You still think they should give \cInitiate{\their} family a chance though. It doesn’t seem like \cInitiate{} understands what it means to be loved like \cInitiate{\they} \cInitiate{\are}.

Your number one priority this weekend is figuring out what happened to your \cLoud{\parent}, \cLoud{}, and fixing it if you can. If \cLoud{\they} were to stop advocating for war, maybe you could get back your simple quiet family life that you miss so much. You refuse to risk the safety of your nation in the meantime, however, and intend to make that very clear in word and deed. Lastly, you do hope to make your own way as more than just your \cLoud{\parent}'s \cWarlordDaughter{\child}.

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Figure out what happened to \cLoud{} and fix it if you can. Foil any plots by the other nations to harm \cLoud{}, yourself, or the \pShip{} at large.
	\item Make sure the Storm does not get sent to the \pShip{}. Win as much voting authority to direct the Storm as you can, both for your own sake and to protect \pShip{}. 
	\item Help \cFlowPriest{} and \cEbbPriest{} secretly resurrect the \cEbb{} avatar. Without it, you cannot choose to follow \cEbb{}'s path. Then, choose a path and become a full Priestess of \cEbb{} or \cFlow{}, or try to walk the extremely difficult path of Balance between them.
	\item Convince \cMusic{} to select you as the student speaker for the Ceremony of Excellence -- then give the best speech possible to distinguish yourself from your \cLoud{\parent}.
	\item Help \cInitiate{} remove \cInitiate{\their} curse, and then convince \cInitiate{\them} to give \cInitiate{\their} family in the \pFarm{} a chance anyway.
\end{itemz}
