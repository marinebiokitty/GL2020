\name{\cFlowPriest{}}

You are \cFlowPriest{\full} (\cFlowPriest{\they}/\cFlowPriest{\them}), and a teacher at the \pSchool{}. You teach Mathematics, and have done so for the last 15 years. Mathematics is the language of nature, and understanding that language allows you to understand and create \emph{beautiful} things, and use that understanding to make balanced decisions. It is through your love of patterns, the predictions they allow, and the creation of new things that you serve \cFlowFull{\full}.

You grew up in the \pShip{}, the \cFlowPriest{\child} of architects in the 4th fleet. You built your first model boat when you were five. In your teenage years, you moved around among a number of ships, ultimately settling in a woodworking compound in 6th fleet Shell Bay. From there you went to 2nd fleet Academy to study Religion. You were drawn particularly to \cFlow{}, and soon completed your initiation to \cFlow{\their} Path. 

You ended up serving in 5th fleet, Coral Sands Harbor town. While the work was nice, you aspired to more. Eventually a position came open at the \pSchool{}, to which you applied and were selected. Ever since then, you have worked at the \pSc{}, shaping the new minds that come through, and sending them out into the world to do \cFlow{}'s work.

Your greatest test came six years ago, when the infamous Betrayal of your people occurred â€“ the Storm was sent to the \pShip{} out of turn, and the 12 students who performed the ritual were murdered by unknown agents. You had your hands full in the immediate aftermath, working closely with \cEthics{\full} to provide emotional support for everyone. Many of your colleagues ended up resigning after that. You nearly quit yourself out of horror and disgust at what had transpired. But no. You had to stand firm. You had to stay, and continue to guide the students down the path of \cFlow{}. 

In the past few years, you have struck up correspondences with several like minded individuals around \pEarth{}. One of your favorites is \cCurse{\full}. Over time the two of you have gone from just chatting about magical theory to actually creating something completely new. Humans have never in recorded history set foot in the Realm of the Gods. But where there is a will, there is a way. You and \cCurse{} have been working for years on the ``\iBeansMB{}'' which, once you complete them, can be planted and will grow into a portal that will connect \pEarth{} to the Realm of the Gods -- you think. You won't know for sure until you try it! The two of you have had little chance to work together in person until this morning, and you expect to be able to finish the beans this weekend! To those who would naysay such endeavors, you ask why they should fear the Deities so. Just because no one has done something yet does not mean it shouldn't be done. Just because a worthy endeavor requires a few taboo rituals doesn't mean you shouldn't try. By the teachings of \cFlow{}, it is quite the opposite - the new and creative is particularly beloved of your Goddess, and what is legal is not always what is beneficial for humanity.

If only things on \pEarth{} were in better shape. The \pFarm{} and the \pTech{} were fools to upset the fragile balance, and the war that \cLoud{\full} brings to bear on them is their just reward. But you fear that someone has meddled further. The \cEbb{} Avatar on \pEarth{} is dead. You know from the lips of the Goddesses to your own ears. Avatars don't die of natural causes. Someone killed it. Someone very strong in magic, who had some way to lure the Avatar to shore, or found a ship treacherous enough to carry them to deep waters, and a weapon capable of the deed. You have little doubt that pirates were involved.

Still, all hope is not lost. It can't be just fortune that \cEbbPriest{\full}, \cEbbPriest{\cleric} of \cEbb{}, is coming to the \pSchool{} as part of the \pShip{} Advisor contingent. Surely, this is a sign that the two of you are destined to work a ritual to resurrect the Avatar! With this in mind, you have enlisted the aid of \cEbbPriest{}, as well as two students who are initiates of the faith, \cInitiate{\full} and \cWarlordDaughter{\full}. Of course, there are complications of which the answers have yet to reveal themselves. Chief among them is the central problem of where you are supposed to get a live sea serpent to act as a host. Not far behind, though, is the matter of keeping things quiet. If word should get out as to what you are trying to do, the other nations would surely try to stop you, as being short an Avatar puts the \pShippies{} at a grave disadvantage in the war. 

If only all of the advisors were as pious as \cEbbPriest{}. \cBunker{\full} in particular concerns you. \cBunker{\Theyare} clearly begrudging in \cBunker{\their} faith. You don't understand why. Just look at all of the things \cBunker{} has created - there are few more prolific engineers in all of \pEarth{}. So why \cBunker{\are} \cBunker{\they} reluctant to celebrate \cBunker{\their} gifts?  You do hope that \cBunker{\their} bad attitude does not rub off on any of the students this weekend.

You and \cEbbPriest{} will have a lot of responsibilities as the best source of comfort and support for the people of your nation. If anyone should express a sincere desire to join the \pShip{} religion, and forsake their own, helping them do that falls to you and \cEbbPriest{} as well. You must impress upon anyone you induct, be it as a cleric or worshiper, to always bear in mind that worship does not diminish the worshiper. It's not a chore, or a burden to celebrate your Patron Goddesses, and the things they enable you to create. Sharing this message is not a task you take lightly. 

It is also your job to guide the two initiates of the faith here, \cInitiate{} and \cWarlordDaughter{}, as they decide which path to pick and, if they prove worthy, to induct them as full fledged clerics. Their right to try for the priesthood shines from the mark of the Goddesses upon their persons. You aren't sure of the reasoning the Goddesses use in who they mark and who they don't, but since time immemorial, none without the mark have ever succeeded in joining the priesthood. In the past century, the priesthood has stopped even letting people try if they don't have the mark. Sometimes you wonder if that rule is short-sighted. You know your view is the minority in the church, however, and that most people think like \cEbbPriest{} does -- no mark means no chance at ever becoming a cleric, end of discussion. You have been quietly flouting that rule with \cPirate{\full}, a fellow teacher who is deeply devoted to becoming a \cPirate{\cleric}. You are convinced of \cPirate{\their} faith and dedication and have been training \cPirate{\them} as an initiate in secret. \cPirate{} DOES NOT bear the mark of the Goddesses, and it has never been known to appear past puberty. At some point you know you will have to come to terms with this fact, decide whether to allow \cPirate{\them} to undertake the ritual, and if so, somehow convince \cEbbPriest{} to go along with it.

Perhaps the most important thing going on this weekend will be the Ritual to Control the Storm. As a teacher, it's important for you to ensure that the ritual goes off without a hitch, that the Relics are being treated respectfully, and that the students (especially the four \pShip{} students) are taking a proper interest in the proceedings. If the ritual were to fail to complete, an uncontrolled disaster of the Storm would rage across all of \pEarth{}, not just one nation. This is obviously something to be avoided at all costs. 

There is also the question of which students should receive the highest voting authority to direct the Storm. You believe that the honor and responsibility should go to \cPresident{\full}, the student body president. \cPresident{\They} \cPresident{\have} such a good head on \cPresident{\their} shoulders, you want to see \cPresident{\them} go as far as possible in secular life, and this would be a great start to that. Having won voting authority will be less important for \cInitiate{} and \cWarlordDaughter{} once they join the priesthood. Your path to this is to convince the \pFarm{} teachers and \pShip{} advisors to Rank \cPresident{} highest.

With so many weighty responsibilities, you really hope that you won't be too busy for the Ceremony of Excellence. It is traditional that a teacher hailing from each of the different nations gives a speech once every three years. Well, this year, the \pShip{} are up, and you are of the opinion that you are the best choice. You know that \cPirate{} has expressed an interest in it too, but really, who could be better to set the students up to create a better world than a current \cFlowPriest{\cleric} of \cFlowFull{\full}? This speech will help shape their mindset during the Time of Deciding, so you need to make sure that you do everything you can to influence that in a positive direction. This speech is also a chance to influence your fellow teachers, and the advisors as well. It's not an opportunity you intend to pass up lightly.

This weekend will be extremely busy. You need to make sure that the ritual goes off without a hitch, resurrect the avatar of your people, and pave the way to meet your deities, all while performing your normal duties as a \cFlowPriest{\cleric} of \cFlow{} and a teacher at the \pSchool{}. You may have a lot to accomplish - but as always, your faith in the balance that defines your people will see you through. 

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Ensure the Ritual to Control the Storm is properly set up, goes smoothly, and that none of the six Relics are tampered with. Encourage as many students as possible to take an active hand in the preparations, and educate them on the functions of all the steps so they can understand the system.
	\item Resurrect the \cEbb{} Avatar and keep the process a secret from the other nations.
	\item Make sure the Storm does not get sent to the \pShip{}. To that end, convince the Children of the Sun teachers and L'eau advisors to rank \cPresident{} highest for voting authority to direct the Storm.
\item Help guide \cInitiate{}, \cWarlordDaughter{}, and \cPirate{} in their path to becoming clerics.
	\item Finish the \iBeansMB{}, plant them, and visit the Realm of the Gods.
\item Convince \cMusic{} to pick you to give the speech in the Ceremony of Excellence and then give a moving and inspiring speech.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item Until the \cEbb{} Avatar is resurrected, both the path of \cEbb{} and the Path of Balance are locked to new initiates.
	\item You teach mathematics at the College of the Gods.
	\item You were present at the school 6 years ago, but too busy trying to console everyone, including yourself, to think it wise to get underfoot with the investigation into the deaths of the students. 
	\item In your work as a cleric, you have heard whisperings of a heretical cult among the \pShip{}, known as the \pGoaties{}. You have few solid facts, but you know they have lured some of the faithful away from the path of the Twin Goddesses, and committed violent acts in the name of their false god, \cGenesis{}.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cCurse{}} A kindred spirit in the \pFarm{}, \cCurse{} has been working with you on the \iBeansMB{} to reach the Divine Plane.
\contact{\cEbbPriest{}} A surprise addition to the Advisor delegation from \pShip{}, but you will be grateful to have \cEbbPriest{\their} support this weekend. \cEbbPriest{\Theyare} more strict about rules than you are, and the two of you don't always see eye-to-eye, even on matters of theology.
	\contact{\cInitiate{}} A trustworthy initiate of the \pShippies{} religion. As \cInitiate{\theyare} graduating this year, it is about time \cInitiate{} picks a path and comes into \cInitiate{\their} full power.
\contact{\cWarlordDaughter{}} An initiate of the \pShippies{} religion. \cWarlordDaughter{} is in \cWarlordDaughter{\their} second year at the \pSc{}, and still has some time to choose a path if \cWarlordDaughter{\they} wish\cWarlordDaughter{\pluralC} to delay.
\contact{\cPirate{}} Your friendly rival for the honor of giving the teacher's speech during the Ceremony of Excellence. More importantly, a devotee to the \pShip{} Goddesses whom you are training in secret to become a \cPirate{\cleric}, despite \cPirate{\their} lack of the mark of the Goddesses.
	\contact{\cBunker{}} An engineer and follower of \textcolor{red}{\cEbb{} \sout{Flow}}. You worry about \cBunker{\their} lack of enthusiasm for giving the Goddesses their due, and intend to shield your initiates \cInitiate{} and \cWarlordDaughter{} from any undue influence \cBunker{\they} might try to exert.
	\contact{\cPresident{}} The student body president, a proud \pShip{}, and the student whom you believe should receive the most votes to direct the Storm.
