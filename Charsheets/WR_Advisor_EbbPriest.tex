\name{\cEbbPriest{}}

You are \cEbbPriest{\full} (\cEbbPriest{\they}/\cEbbPriest{\them}), and well along in years. You are a \cEbbPriest{\cleric} of \cEbbFull{\full}, and an advisor from the \pShip{}. You treat the sacred duties of your Priesthood with all of the gravity they deserve, and bear up well under the weight of many responsibilities among the \pShippies{}. While you initially had no plans to attend the events at the \pSchool{} this weekend, it seems your \cEbb{\God} had other ideas.

You grew up in 7th fleet, the child of Clerics of \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}. Though you traveled aboard several ships in your youth, you soon returned to the Monastery at Southern Atoll to pursue studies in the priesthood. Very little fulfills you like the spirited debates of theology at the Monastery. Still, no \cEbbPriest{\cleric} of \cEbb{} can live their entire life inside the Monastery. The work of the Goddesses is out among the people. So out you went, to help people learn to let go of the old, to make room for the new. For that is what \cEbb{} is all about: ends, closure, and moving on; cleaning up, learning lessons, and preparing for the next step.

On your own time, you have cultivated a love of history. Most particularly, you have made a study of the creation story of \pEarth{}. It seems no one in recent memory has put much care into the small differences between the way the story is told in each of the nations. But some of the older stories are quite different from how the stories are told today, and the question of what really happened intrigues you deeply. You've corresponded at times with clerics from all over, including \cBeetle{\full}, and \cFlowPriest{\full}, who both work at the \pSchool{}, as well as \cAntiChup{\full} from the \pTech{} and \cHedonist{\full} from the \pFarm{}. You never expected to have a chance to meet up with all of these people in person, let alone at the same time - and at the \pSchool{} no less! Truly, the Goddesses work in mysterious ways. \cBeetle{} has shown the most interest in your research, and you had hoped to work with \cBeetle{\them} directly this weekend, but it would appear \cBeetle{\they} \cBeetle{\have} decided to delegate the task to  \cHeadScientist{\full} as a ``learning opportunity.'' You are trying not to feel too disappointed, but honestly, what are you supposed to do with \cHeadScientist{}, who only seems to have taken an interest in religion in the past few weeks? 

Sadly, this felicitous gathering is but a consolation prize when viewed next to the terrible reason you came to lead the \pShip{} delegation this year in the first place. You were on an errand for the church just yesterday when you were summoned to a private residence in order to conduct an investigation. It is not unusual to call upon a member of the priesthood to investigate crimes where the Deities have enacted a punishment, so you weren't particularly surprised when you first heard the request -- that is, until you recognized the address you were being summoned to.

The storied diplomat \cHeadDiplomat{\full} had been found by \cHeadDiplomat{\their} spouse that morning, without a memory to \cHeadDiplomat{\their} name, blood on \cHeadDiplomat{\their} hands, and a dead body on the floor. Since \cHeadDiplomat{} was scheduled to lead the delegation to the \pSc{} very shortly, the utmost speed and discretion were necessary in the investigation. Luckily for you, the motive in this case was obvious. The dead body belonged to someone who had taken great pains to be untraceable – obviously an assassin. It followed, then, that \cHeadDiplomat{} had been attacked in the night and killed in self defense. You did your best to reassure \cHeadDiplomat{\their} spouse that \cHeadDiplomat{\their} memories might yet return - the Deities are sometimes merciful when self defense is involved. But such things take time, and the problem of the delegation still loomed. After some consideration, you determined that you needed to lead the delegation yourself in \cHeadDiplomat{}'s stead.

After this decision, you quickly explained your findings to \cJuniorStatesman{\full} (\cHeadDiplomat{}'s apprentice and moderately competent assistant negotiator), and \cChupLeader{\full} (\cHeadDiplomat{}'s secretary), both of whom had been planning to accompany \cHeadDiplomat{} to the \pSc{}. You are grateful to have people who worked so closely with \cHeadDiplomat{} to assist you. You then concocted a story that \cHeadDiplomat{} is deathly ill as a cover for the true circumstances. It is imperative that no one find out that \cHeadDiplomat{\they} \cHeadDiplomat{\were} almost assassinated - the situation of the \pShip{} is far too precarious for such an upheaval. The war is at a tipping point, and your ability to negotiate for a fair and balanced treaty is at stake.

Politics are a nearly impossible balance of half truths and hard choices. But your expertise is in bring things to conclusion. As tragic as what happened to \cHeadDiplomat{} is, you can't shake the feeling that maybe you were \emph{meant} to be here this weekend. Someone needs to step up and mediate the treaty negotiations -- and clearly, that someone was meant to be you. Not that you intend to let the other nations get away without restoring balance - reparations must be paid, and a new understanding regarding the storm drawn up. One that spares the \pShip{} for long enough to rebuild; let the other nations take the Storm upon themselves for at least the next 4 cycles. That should begin to restore the balance that was destroyed with the original betrayal. You expect to find a shrewd adversary in \cDiplomat{\full}, the lead diplomat from the \pTech{}, and the author of the despicable alliance with the \pFarm{} that began the Betrayal. Come to think of it, \cDiplomat{} stood to gain the most from \cHeadDiplomat{} being taken out of the picture. Could it be that \cDiplomat{\they} sent the assassin? But if you are going to salvage the treaty negotiations, you don't have time to personally investigate such leads; perhaps you can delegate that to \cJuniorStatesman{} or \cChupLeader{}? You have some hope that \cJuniorStatesman{} would take that initiative on \cJuniorStatesman{\their} own, but \cChupLeader{} strikes you as the kind to do what \cChupLeader{\theyare} told and not a drop more.

To help soothe what you imagine could be some frustration on \cJuniorStatesman{}'s part when you took over the treaty negotiations, you delegated \cJuniorStatesman{\them} the equally crucial task of minding the students, and how they will vote to Control the storm. Among your duties as an advisor is to rank the students to determine which should get the most voting authority to direct the Storm. You feel that none of the students show proper reverence for the Twin Goddesses, but if you must pick one, let it be \cWarlordDaughter{\full}– both because \cWarlordDaughter{\theyare} your esteemed Warlord's \cWarlordDaughter{\child} and because \cWarlordDaughter{\theyare} an Initiate of the faith, albeit a reluctant one in your opinion. Your best bet for helping \cWarlordDaughter{} win the most votes is to convince the other \pShip{} advisors and the \pFarm{} teachers to rank \cWarlordDaughter{\them} the highest. You expect that \cJuniorStatesman{} can handle the rest.

To make matters worse for the \pShip{}, it seems that the Avatar of your patron \cEbb{\God} is dead. You know from the lips of the Goddesses to your own ears that the Sea Serpent Avatar of \cEbb{} no longer swims on \pEarth{}. This is obviously foul play - Avatars don't simply die of natural causes. That means \emph{someone} killed it. Someone very strong in magic, who had some way to lure the Avatar to shore -- or found a ship treacherous enough to carry them to deep waters, and a weapon capable of the deed. You have little doubt that pirates were involved -- and sooner or later, you will make them pay for it.

Still, all hope is not lost. It can't be just fortune that \cFlowPriest{}, a highly respected and powerful \cFlowPriest{\cleric} of \cFlowFull{\full}, is a teacher at the \pSchool{}. Surely, this is a sign that the two of you are destined to work a ritual to resurrect the Avatar! When \cFlowPriest{} first wrote to you of the problem, you could send only your best wishes -- but now you will be physically present to assist. Of course, there are complications of which the answers have yet to reveal themselves. Chief among them is the central problem – where you are supposed to get a live sea serpent to act as a host? Not far behind, though, is the matter of how to keep things quiet. If word should get out as to what you are trying to do, the other nations would surely try to stop you, as being short an Avatar puts the \pShippies{} at a grave disadvantage in the war. You have explained the situation to your fellow \pShip{} advisors, and are grateful to have them on hand to assist you.

While you are here at the \pSc{}, you are still a \cEbbPriest{\cleric} of \cEbb{}. You have a duty to the \pShippies{} and indeed to anyone who expresses a need for support or council. Chief among your attention will be \cInitiate{\full} and \cWarlordDaughter{}, two initiates to the religion of \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}, who have yet to pick their path and take their final vows. As with every other initiate, they bear the mark of the Goddesses upon their persons. No one is allowed to try for the priesthood without it (represented as a temporary tattoo either on the player's body, or tucked into their badge holder). Becoming a member of the clergy is not a decision to take lightly, and you intend to find out for yourself whether these two are truly ready for the life they purport to want. 

A cleric's work is never done. As the head of the delegation, and a \cEbbPriest{\cleric}, you bear with you the ``\iChalice{},'' one of the two relics of the \pShip{} which might be used for the ritual. It is yours to protect, or entrust someone to protect, until it is ready to return to its protections at the 1st fleet Monastery. You also have the ability to assess the state of the relics for the ritual - sometimes people are too enamored of the powers a relic has to care about the consequences of them becoming de-attuned in the usage.

So while your presence here this weekend was unexpected to you, and probably to most or all of your fellow advisors, it is obvious your Goddesses had a hand in it. Your role here is three-fold: to guide \pEarth{} to a proper closure on the war, to uncover the truth of the Creation of \pEarth{}, and to serve as a \cEbbPriest{\cleric} in all the ways you might be called upon to do it. This is your moment, and you intend to rise to the occasion.

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Take up \cHeadDiplomat{}'s role and mediate the treaty discussions. Ensure that any treaty signed is properly balanced and accounts for the pain and suffering of your people.
	\item Act as a pillar of morality and spirituality to all people by fulfilling the myriad duties of being a \cEbbPriest{\cleric} of \cEbbFull{\full}.
	\item Work with \cFlowPriest{} to resurrect the \cEbb{} Avatar.
	\item Make sure the Storm doesn't get sent to the \pShip{}, and convince the other \pShip{} advisors and the \pFarm{} teachers to rank \cWarlordDaughter{} the highest for voting authority to direct the Storm.
	\item Safeguard \iChalice{} to ensure no harm comes to it. Assist the teachers as needed with preparations for the Ritual to Control the Storm.
	\item Research the War of the Gods - this is your chance to find the truth long lost.
	\item Guide \cInitiate{} and \cWarlordDaughter{} in their final steps to becoming full fledged clerics of \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}.
	\item Work with \cJuniorStatesman{} and \cChupLeader{} to ensure no one finds out the truth about why \cHeadDiplomat{} isn't here, and assign your subordinates to investigate the assassination attempt.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You have never been to the College of the Gods before.
	\item In your work as a \cEbbPriest{\cleric}, you have heard whisperings of a heretical cult among the \pShip{}, known as the \pGoaties{}. You have few solid facts, but you know they have lured some of the faithful away from the path of the Twin Goddesses, and committed violent acts in the name of their false god, \cGenesis{}.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cJuniorStatesman{}} \cHeadDiplomat{}'s apprentice and assistant negotiator. You have tasked \cJuniorStatesman{} with managing the voting to control the storm -- a task of equal import to negotiating the treaty. You don't know \cJuniorStatesman{\them} well, but your impression is that \cJuniorStatesman{\theyare} competent and reliable.
	\contact{\cChupLeader{}} \cHeadDiplomat{}'s secretary. Organized, professional, but lacking self motivation. You hope \cChupLeader{\they} will be able to partially fill the hole \cHeadDiplomat{} left behind.
	\contact{\cFlowPriest{}} A \cFlowPriest{\cleric} of \cFlow{}, who has recruited your help with the urgent need to resurrect the \cEbb{} Avatar. \cFlowPriest{\Theyare} more lax about the rules than you are, and this sometimes leads to trouble – a.k.a. messes that you have to clean up. The two of you don't always see eye to eye, even in matters of theology.
	\contact{\cInitiate{}} An initiate of the \pShippie{} religion. As \cInitiate{\they} \cInitiate{\are} graduating this year, it is past time \cInitiate{} picks a path and comes into \cInitiate{\their} full power, or decide that this is not the life for \cInitiate{\them}. You suspect \cInitiate{\theyare} dragging \cInitiate{\their} feet on purpose.
	\contact{\cWarlordDaughter{}} An initiate of the \pShippie{} religion, and the Warlord's \cWarlordDaughter{\child}. \cWarlordDaughter{} is in \cWarlordDaughter{\their} second year at the school, and you doubt \cWarlordDaughter{\their} conviction for this life.
	\contact{\cBunker{}} An engineer, follower of \cFlow{}, and your fellow advisor. \cBunker{\They} play\cBunker{\plural} an important role in maintaining the bunkers, and you have a lot of respect for \cBunker{\their} manifestation of the will of \cFlow{}. Still, \cBunker{\they} could stand to be a little more enthusiastic about \cBunker{\their} religious obligations.
\end{contacts}
