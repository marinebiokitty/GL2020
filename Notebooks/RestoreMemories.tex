\startnotebook{\nRestoreMemories{}}

\begin{page}{first}
\cDisney{} is one of your best friends, and \cDisney{\their} birthday is on Sunday of this weekend. Given the gravity of the Time of Deciding, it seems perhaps in bad taste to organize a party, but you would still like to do something for them. Despite being an inventor, you haven’t hit upon a material gift you could buy or make that really feels right. Instead, you want to help \cDisney{} restore \cDisney{\their} memories. \cDisney{} has mentioned on several occasions that \cDisney{\they} cannot remember important things around the time they were put to sleep. You’d like to see if you can fix that. When the game starts, open \nbref{second}
\end{page}

\begin{page}{second}
The most well known cause of memory loss is punishment from the Deities for murder. But the scope of things \cDisney{} has forgotten is so small and specific, it can’t possibly be the same thing. Ask at least 5 people if they know of any other reason why someone might lose memories. When you’re done asking, open \nbref{third}
\end{page}

\begin{page}{third}
Not a lot of leads, but maybe the library holds the answer? You remember seeing ``The River of Forgetting’’ on a partial list of the wonders accessible somewhere in the library. You think a sample of the water will actually be key to \textbf{restoring} \cDisney{}’s memories. In order to get some, you’ll need a ``\iGlassVial{}’’. Take the vial to the ``River of Forgetting’’ in the 4th/Extreme Tier of the library. Write on the vial as instructed by that page of the library’s choose-your-own adventure booklet. Once you’ve accomplished this, open \nbref{fourth}
\end{page}

\begin{page}{fourth}
Next you need to change the nature of the water from Forgetting to Remembering. Bring the vial filled with water from the River of Forgetting to Prometheus’ Flame in the old wing of the \pSc{}. Heat the vial over the flame for at least 30 seconds. Then, open \nbref{fifth}
\end{page}

\begin{page}{fifth}
Take the vial to the garden. Bury it in the dirt by placing it in ``Sign-M’’ in the garden. (there is another item in the envelope; ignore it for now.) The effect developing in the vial needs at least 30 minutes to mature. Once the time has elapsed, open \nbref{sixth}
\end{page}

\begin{page}{sixth}
You may now retrieve the vial and the ``\iMemoryCure{}’’ item from ``\sSignM{}’’. Return the vial item card to the nearest stock; it has been transformed into what you hope will restore \cDisney{}’s lost memories. Apply a symbol or design to one corner of the item envelope. This is your maker’s mark. Don’t use anything you’ve seen on other curses, or anything that makes it obvious it is your mark (e.g.: don’t use your character or player signature.) Roleplay emptying the contents of the ``\iMemoryCure{}’’ over \cDisney{}, then tell them OOC to open their ``A Packet.’’ Fingers crossed this works! (Return the ``\iMemoryCure{}’’ item to the nearest stock after this; it has been used up.)
